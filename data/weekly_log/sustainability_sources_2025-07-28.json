Alle taler om, at \u201cfremtiden er elektrisk\u201d, men alligevel mangler der alts\u00e5 elektrikere! Og ingeni\u00f8rer. Og bygningsh\u00e5ndv\u00e6rkere.\n\nI det hele taget mangler vi folk med b\u00e6redygtige kompetencer. Medarbejdere, der ikke kun lige kort engang under uddannelsesforl\u00f8bet har snuset lidt til \"det der med b\u00e6redygtighed\", men som har opdateret viden.\n\nHvordan sikrer vi, at den 23-\u00e5rige nyuddannede elektriker de n\u00e6ste 50 \u00e5r bliver holdt up to date med nyeste viden?\n\nHer ligger en gigantisk og hastende udfordring til vores uddannelsessystem.\n\nJeg husker, da vi i EU-Kommissionen under den \u00f8konomiske krise i 2011/12 skulle have medlemslandene med p\u00e5 at forts\u00e6tte klimaambitionerne selv i en sv\u00e6r tid med 26 millioner arbejdsl\u00f8se i EU.\n\nKommissionsformand Barroso tog til topm\u00f8de bel\u00e6sset med masser af argumenter, slides og grafer. Men der var \u00e9t argument, der for alvor bet\u00f8d noget: Job!\n\nDet afg\u00f8rende argument var, at Kommissionen kunne vise, at energieffektivisering, VE, gr\u00f8n innovation og i det hele taget det gr\u00f8nne omr\u00e5de var \u00e9n af tre sektorer i Europa med potentiale til at skabe substantielt flere job.\n\nJob-argumentet g\u00e6lder stadig, og det g\u00e6lder mere end nogensinde, at her er den store test. For hvis den folkelige opbakning til klimaambitionerne skal fastholdes, s\u00e5 skal b\u00e6redygtighed, klima og gr\u00f8n omstilling t\u00e6nkes ind i arbejdsmarkedspolitikken - nu!\n\nN\u00e5r snakken falder p\u00e5 100.000 job i kulminerne i Polen, s\u00e5 kan alle se udfordringen.\n\nN\u00e5r man st\u00e5r i Volkswagens hovedkvarter i Wolfsburg, hvor 60.000 mennesker hver eneste dag m\u00f8der ind p\u00e5 arbejde, kan ingen v\u00e6re i tvivl om, at det er en gigantisk udfordring at g\u00e5 fra \u00e9n teknologi til en anden.\n\nAlle kan se, at vi skal fra A til B, men hvordan?\n\nMen hva\u2019... her i Danmark har vi da styr p\u00e5 det der med kompetencerne, ikke?\n\nBlandt andet ved vi jo fra historien, at da vi fra 1970\u2019erne og frem var first movers p\u00e5 milj\u00f8politik, energi- og vandbesparelser, isolering, fjernvarme og siden p\u00e5 vind og smarte energinet, ja s\u00e5 kastede det job, eksport, velstand og internationale anerkendte brands og virksomheder af sig.\n\nVi kunne dengang, s\u00e5 vi kan vel stadig v\u00e6k?\n\n\u00c5benbart ikke bedre end at Boston Consulting Group i en ny rapport konkluderer, at 34 procent af den danske arbejdskraft ikke har de kompetencer, som arbejdsgiverne eftersp\u00f8rger. Selv om det pr\u00e6cise tal sikkert kan diskuteres, s\u00e5 har vi alts\u00e5 en kompetence-kl\u00f8ft.\n\nI Vollswagen troede de, at det ville koste dyrt p\u00e5 besk\u00e6ftigelsen at satse p\u00e5 elbiler. De troede, at det ville v\u00e6re umuligt at lave omstillingen uden store sociale konsekvenser og massivt tab af arbejdspladser i bilindustrien.\n\nMen man skal ikke tro, man skal vide, s\u00e5 de bad Fraunhofer Institute om at unders\u00f8ge sagen. Og det viser sig, at det godt kan lade sig g\u00f8re. Hvis der er en plan, og hvis tiltag fases fornuftigt ind med start nu - og forudsat at der sker en gevaldig opprioritering af efter- og videreuddannelse, af opkvalificering og omskoling.\n\nMed andre ord: Jo, man kan godt lave gr\u00f8n omstilling. Ogs\u00e5 inden for en kortere tidshorisont, men det kr\u00e6ver investeringer, det kr\u00e6ver strategisk fokus, og det kr\u00e6ver, at man rent faktisk t\u00f8r prioritere og satse p\u00e5 noget.\n\nS\u00e5 lad os se at f\u00e5 integreret b\u00e6redygtighed b\u00e5de i vores uddannelsessystem fra folkeskolen og opefter og i virksomhederne. Ikke kun i de f\u00f8dte \"gr\u00f8nne\" virksomheder.\n\nPointen er jo s\u00e5dan set, at b\u00e6redygtighed skal v\u00e6re den nye norm over alt, hvorfor det skal afspejles i s\u00e5vel l\u00e6re- og l\u00e6seplaner som i produktionsplaner og -processer.\n\nSelvf\u00f8lgelig vil nogle job forandre sig. Nogle vil endda forsvinde. S\u00e5dan er det altid.\n\nMen det afg\u00f8rende er, om vi som samfund og f\u00e6llesskab form\u00e5r hurtigt at gribe de personer, der ellers risikerer at miste deres job. At vi skaber innovation, s\u00e5 der er et alternativt perspektiv.\n\nDerfor haster det med at f\u00e5 prioriteret omr\u00e5det. Ogs\u00e5 n\u00e5r arbejdsmarkedets parter forhandler overenskomster. Medarbejderne m\u00e5 inddrages og f\u00f8le sig betrygget i, at den gr\u00f8nne omstilling er for alle.\n\nLyder det sv\u00e6rt? Tjo. Men ogs\u00e5 det har vi jo gjort f\u00f8r.\n\nSer vi tilbage p\u00e5 den industrielle revolution, var netop arbejdskraft og opkvalificering et af omdrejningspunkterne for den succesfulde omstilling. Og den bevidste bestr\u00e6belse p\u00e5 at f\u00e5 den brede befolkning med i dannelsesprojektet dengang var afg\u00f8rende for det samfund, vi har i dag.\n\nIntet samfund er bedre positioneret end det danske til at lykkes med omstillingen. Fundamentet er i orden. Ikke mindst takket v\u00e6re kombinationen af en st\u00e6rk uddannelsestradition, st\u00e6rke parter p\u00e5 arbejdsmarkedet og traditionen for offentligt/privat samarbejde.\n\nMen hvis vi ikke bare skal v\u00e6re dem med de tekniske l\u00f8sninger, men ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re dem, der viser verden, at den gr\u00f8nne omstilling ikke beh\u00f8ver f\u00f8re til polarisering, ja s\u00e5 haster det med at f\u00e5 bygget bro over kompetencekl\u00f8ften.\n\nDet kr\u00e6ver nyt\u00e6nkning af efter- og videreuddannelsesomr\u00e5det, og det kr\u00e6ver, at flere f\u00e5r lyst til at v\u00e6lge de fag, der bidrager til, at gr\u00f8nne ord og fine m\u00e5l oms\u00e6ttes til gr\u00f8n og konkret handling.\n\nHer ligger virkelig en hasteopgave for den danske model. For f\u00f8rst og sidst kr\u00e6ver det, at der investeres i sagen nu. B\u00e5de \u00f8konomisk og politisk.",

      "text": "By Danielle Bochove\n\nJul 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) \u2013The world\u2019s oceans experienced a staggering amount of warming in 2023, as vast marine heat waves affected 96% of their surface, breaking records for intensity, longevity and scale, according to a new study.\n\nThat could mark a turning point in the way the oceans behave, potentially signaling a tipping point after which average sea temperatures will be reset higher and some ecosystems may not recover, say the authors of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\n\u201cThe ocean going to a new normal \u2014 that controls everything,\u201d said Zhenzhong Zeng, an Earth systems scientist at China\u2019s Southern University of Science and Technology, who led the work. \u201cOnce we destroy it, then maybe it cannot go back.\u201d\n\nNinety percent of the 2023 oceanic heating anomalies occurred in the North Atlantic, Tropical Eastern Pacific, North Pacific and Southwest Pacific. The average length of the heat waves was 120 days \u2014 four times the average length between 1980 and 2023, according to Tianyun Dong, lead author on the paper and an Earth systems scientist at China\u2019s Eastern Institute of Technology. The North Atlantic marine heat wave, which began in 2022, stretched for 525 days.\n\n\u201cThe ocean has a long memory,\u201d Dong said. It plays a key role regulating global temperatures by storing and gradually releasing large amounts of heat, but because it is slower to react than the atmosphere, the impact of long-term heat changes can be both delayed and enormous.\n\nRead more: Octopus Invasion In English Channel Shows Risks From Warming Seas\n\nThe researchers used a combination of real-world measurements from the ocean, satellite data and computer modeling to determine the scope and causes of the heating. The highest temperature spike was seen in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, which was 1.63C degrees hotter than normal. While the onset of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phase likely contributed to that, a key finding of the paper is the extent to which different drivers played a role in marine heat waves in different locations. Other factors include increased solar radiation from reduced cloud cover; weaker winds; and changes in ocean currents \u2014 factors which can themselves be caused by global warming. Taken together, they show climate change is having an intensifying impact on the oceans.\n\nWhat the paper doesn\u2019t explain is why so many drivers came together in 2023, resulting in so many smashed records, said Zeng. It may be that these changes are beginning to reinforce each other in ways that are not yet understood. Identifying such feedback loops, and figuring out their mechanics, is critical to understanding future heat events, he said.\n\nIn the near term, a marine heat wave can be devastating for humans who depend on the ocean for their livelihood, like fishing communities. \u201cIt can also fuel stronger hurricanes and storms along the coast,\u201d said Yuntian Chen, a researcher in mechanics at China\u2019s Eastern Institute of Technology and one of the study\u2019s authors.\n\nAnd if ocean heat reaches a tipping point, some species won\u2019t recover. There are already concerns this could be the case for some of the world\u2019s largest coral reefs. That has other ramifications: The loss of coral and kelp, for example, reduces the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon, which leads to more heating.\n\nThe hottest year on record was 2023 \u2014 until 2024, when the Earth\u2019s average temperature reached 1.55C above the pre-industrial average, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and when the average ocean temperatures hit a new high. This year is unlikely to break the annual record again, but is expected to come close. June 2025 was the third-warmest June in 176 years, after 2024 and 2023, according to a recent report by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe WMO tracks global temperatures based on six international datasets, including one run by NOAA, whose NCEI Coastal Water Temperature Guide was decommissioned by the US government in May.\n\nZeng\u2019s team relied on NOAA data for its work, some of which is no longer available.\n\nThe cutbacks are \u201ca disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all living on the same planet. The climate is really changing.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Reuters reported yesterday that Russia has imposed a sudden halt on foreign oil tanker loadings at its key Black Sea export hubs, citing a new port security decree that requires Federal Security Service (FSB) clearance for all foreign vessels \u2014 a move poised to disrupt over 2% of global crude supply.\n\nThe restriction, which took effect immediately following president Vladimir Putin\u2019s executive order earlier this week, is impacting operations at Novorossiisk and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) terminal at Yuzhnaya Ozereevka. The CPC handles over 80% of Kazakhstan\u2019s crude exports.\n\nUntil now, FSB clearance was only required for ships entering ports near Russian naval bases. Under the new rules, all ships \u201cen route from foreign ports\u201d will be required to secure authorisation from an official representative of the FSB in coordination with the port captain.\n\nThe clampdown follows recent port mishaps \u2014 including explosions, sabotage incidents, and drone attacks \u2014 that have threatened Russia\u2019s oil infrastructure. Officially, authorities cite regulatory violations, but the timing aligns with heightened domestic security measures and escalating Western sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s energy sector.\n\nThere has been a string of unexplained explosions targeting tankers linked to Russian trade, some occurring thousands of kilometres from Russian shores, most recently aboard StealthGas\u2019s ammonia tanker Eco Wizard at the Ust-Luga energy hub earlier this month. That blast\u2014officially described as a \u201cminor leak\u201d\u2014triggered the evacuation of the vessel and temporary port closure. Damage inspection revealed large holes in the hull, with metal bent inward, fuelling speculation of an external attack.\n\nMaritime security experts and Western intelligence services have speculated that Ukraine may be escalating a covert sabotage campaign aimed at disrupting Russian oil exports.\n\nThe Eco Wizard blast followed similar incidents in February, when the Turkish-owned Koala was rocked by three explosions at Ust-Luga, and in June, when the Vilamoura, a suezmax managed by TMS Tankers, was hit after calling at Russian ports.\n\nThe Ust-Luga incidents are part of a growing list of maritime explosions involving tankers linked to Russian trade, including outside the Baltic. In recent months, explosions on the Seajewel and Seacharm (both aframaxes managed by Thenamaris) in the Mediterranean, as well as the Grace Ferrum off Libya, have raised alarms among maritime security experts, many of whom suspect the use of limpet mines.\n\nIn December 2024, the Ursa Major, a Russian general cargo ship, sank in the western Mediterranean following an underwater explosion. While official statements have often downplayed these events, local authorities and international observers increasingly view them as a coordinated campaign against Russia\u2019s export of fossil fuels.\n\nLast week, Russia\u2019s state-run port operator FSUE Rosmorport announced a RUB3.16bn ($39.5m) tender to inspect the underwater sections of vessels at key Baltic Sea ports amid mounting concerns over maritime sabotage.",

      "text": "Matthieu de Tugny, executive vice president at Bureau Veritas, has a new book out called Toward a sustainable blue economy, which addresses the complex challenges that the industry currently faces in its pursuit of more sustainable operations, whilst also looking at the need for industry-wide transformation in how we finance, fuel and operate the global fleet. Today, he writes exclusively for Splash.\n\nToday\u2019s maritime industry faces unprecedented uncertainty as it navigates geopolitical tensions, shifting trade dynamics, and a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. However, whilst managing these competing challenges, shipping must not lose sight of its responsibility to protect the world\u2019s oceans, its resources and the planet it sustains.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest and most vital mode of trade, shipping sits at the heart of the ocean economy, a large and fast-growing economic sector with significant untapped potential. But if we are to ensure the future health and prosperity of our industry at the same time as protecting the marine environment and responsibly growing the wider ocean economy, it is vital that shipping challenges the deeply conservative financial frameworks that underpin it.\n\nThe ocean economy is estimated to be worth $2.2trn annually, encompassing everything from global trade to tourism, fisheries and offshore energy. Marine-based activity has outpaced global GDP growth for decades, and shipping, in particular, has experienced a period of sustained growth in recent years. In 2023, over 12bn tonnes of cargo were transported by sea, 2.6 times the volume shipped in 1995.\n\nBut while this economic expansion represents a positive signal of the industry\u2019s resilience, the environmental cost is undeniable. Over 90% of the global fleet still runs on polluting fuel oil, and decarbonising the industry will cost between $8bn and $28 bn annually, with the price tag for infrastructure upgrades potentially reaching $90bn.\n\nThese are daunting figures for owners navigating uncertain fuel availability, evolving regulations, and variable demand. Furthermore, the industry is having to contend with a rapidly aging global fleet that will see approximately 15,000 vessels reach the end of their economic life within the next 10 years. In light of shipping\u2019s growing capital needs as a result of these challenges, it is essential that the industry invests in \u201cgreen ships\u201d that are fit to support a decarbonized shipping sector.\n\nIn order to fund this imbalance, the industry could embrace a shift to green financing models that indelibly link capital with climate performance. This concept is not new. In 2019, a collective of global shipping financial institutions and industry organizations launched the Posidon Principles, a global framework to ensure continued alignment of shipping portfolios with global climate goals, and which represents over $240bn in today\u2019s global shipping finance.\n\nFrom a public finance perspective, regional bodies \u2013 such as the EU Innovation Fund \u2013 are investing significantly in green fuels and zero-emission vessel pilots, as well as bunkering infrastructure to support the industry in managing its green transition.\n\nShipping\u2019s complex operational landscape also provides a significant opportunity to double down on the progress that has been made in elevating the role of green financing by departing from its traditional conservative financial models that prioritize short-term cost efficiency, in favour of investment that is directly tied to achieving long-term environmental gain. In a decarbonized world, financing mechanisms must evolve to facilitate the green transition, but they also have to find a way to incentivize all stakeholders and requirements.\n\nAs the sustainable finance landscape evolves, financial institutions must also adjust their sentiment to maritime investment markets in order to consider evolving regulatory frameworks and address the value chains and industry levers that will ultimately drive sustainable finance. Only then will the industry be in a position to correct the current imbalance between economic growth and environmental stewardship.\n\nA sustainable blue economy isn\u2019t a distant vision; it\u2019s an urgent necessity. However, in order to achieve this collective goal, the maritime industry must reimagine the interconnected systems, processes and practices that have remained unchanged for decades.",

      "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court has ordered the owners and operators of the X-Press Pearl container vessel to pay $1bn in compensation for the devastating environmental and economic damage caused when the ship caught fire and sank off Colombo in 2021.\n\nDescribed by the court as \u201cthe most severe marine environmental catastrophe in the country\u2019s history\u201d, the incident involved the Singapore-flagged vessel catching fire on May 20, 2021, while carrying hazardous cargo including 25 tonnes of nitric acid and over 1,500 containers. Despite weeks of firefighting efforts, the vessel sank on June 2, 2021, unleashing vast quantities of toxins and plastic pellets- also known as nurdles \u2013 into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe fallout was catastrophic: extensive marine pollution, mass deaths of marine wildlife\u2014417 sea turtles, 48 dolphins, eight whales\u2014and severe disruptions to coastal ecosystems. A year-long fishing ban further devastated the livelihoods of thousands of Sri Lankans.\n\nThe court directed the $1bn be paid to the secretary to the treasury in instalments within one year. A MV X-Press Pearl Compensation Commission, chaired by retired justice E.A.G.R. Amarasekera, will oversee the restitution and rehabilitation process. The bench also directed Sri Lanka\u2019s attorney general to expedite criminal investigations against those involved, including local agents and officials accused of inaction.\n\nThe ruling named the vessel\u2019s owner, EOS Ro, charterers, and local agent Sea Consortium Lanka\u2014all Singapore-based\u2014as liable under the polluter pays principle. It found that these parties had acknowledged environmental harm but failed to offer credible assessments or counterclaims to the losses presented.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the state had also failed its citizens. Then minister of environment Nalaka Godahewa and the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) were found to have violated fundamental rights by failing to take prompt preventive action. The ruling came in response to multiple fundamental rights petitions filed by environmentalists, fishing communities, and religious leaders.\n\nThe court declared the incident \u201cthe largest recorded marine plastic spill in the world\u201d, citing the unprecedented release of hazardous materials that poisoned waters and harmed phytoplankton\u2014critical to ocean ecosystems. The judgment also noted the disaster\u2019s long-term effects, with pollution and ecological damage still evident four years on.\n\nThe owners and their representatives have yet to publicly comment on the ruling.\n\nThe full story of how the X-Press Pearl came to meet its fiery end in Sri Lanka has overtones of previous ship catastrophes such as the 2002 Prestige tanker incident and should fan the flames in the ongoing places of refuge debate.\n\nSpeaking with Splash in the wake of the disaster four years ago, Tim Hartnoll, the executive chairman of X-Press Feeders, said that poor packaging was responsible for an acid leak, which the crew had detected in some containers while in the Arabian Sea, thousands of kilometres away from Sri Lanka. On detecting the leak, the ship\u2019s captain then contacted two ports \u2013 Hazira on the west coast of India and Hamad in Qatar \u2013 requesting to offload the containers in question. The requests were denied, and the brand new ship made its way to Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cIt was a case of not in my backyard syndrome,\u201d Hartnoll said.",

      "text": "Russia has tightened access to its seaports, with president Vladimir Putin signing a decree on Monday mandating that all vessels arriving from foreign ports must now obtain prior approval from the country\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\nThe executive order, which takes effect immediately, marks a significant expansion of wartime maritime controls. Until now, FSB clearance was only required for ships entering ports near Russian naval bases. Under the new rules, all ships \u201cen route from foreign ports\u201d will be required to secure authorisation from an official representative of the FSB in coordination with the port captain.\n\nThe Kremlin has not provided a formal rationale for the move, but the decree cites a constitutional provision governing military conditions \u2014 a likely reference to ongoing martial law statutes in regions of Russia bordering Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a string of unexplained explosions targeting tankers linked to Russian trade, some occurring thousands of kilometres from Russian shores, most recently aboard StealthGas\u2019s ammonia tanker Eco Wizard at the Ust-Luga energy hub earlier this month.

Ambrey is advising shipping companies to conduct asset screening assessments for all charter-party agreements and purchases, and to carry out dynamic voyage risk assessments.",

The move follows the recent collapse of a previously planned asset deal between the two state-backed players.\n\nCMES will invest up to RMB1.8bn ($250 m) via its subsidiary Sinotrans Container Lines, using a combination of block trades, centralised bidding, and negotiated transfers to purchase 333.7m shares of Antong, equal to 7.89% of the company.
