Men hvis vi skal n\u00e5 hele vejen i m\u00e5l med den gr\u00f8nne omstilling, er det afg\u00f8rende, at vi nu ogs\u00e5 retter blikket mod bygge- og anl\u00e6gssektoren. Denne sektor har hidtil ikke modtaget samme opm\u00e6rksomhed i finanslovens forskningsreserve p\u00e5 trods af sektorens enorme klimaaftryk og potentiale for forbedring. Ligesom energisektoren og landbruget har byggeriet behov for m\u00e5lrettede investeringer i forskning og innovation for at kunne udvikle de l\u00f8sninger, der skal b\u00e6re os frem mod 2050-m\u00e5lene. Danmark har sat sig ambiti\u00f8se klimam\u00e5l, og bygge- og anl\u00e6gssektoren spiller en afg\u00f8rende rolle, hvis vi skal lykkes. Sektoren st\u00e5r for markante dele af vores samlede klimaaftryk og ressourceforbrug. Faktisk udg\u00f8r den hele 33 procent af Danmarks materialeforbrug, 22 procent af Danmarks globale CO2-udledning og 40 procent af Danmarks samlede affaldsm\u00e6ngde if\u00f8lge en rapport fra 2024 fra Byggeriets Handletank for B\u00e6redygtighed. Med et samlet etageareal p\u00e5 over 800 millioner kvadratmeter bygninger og en enorm \u00f8konomisk betydning er det tydeligt, at udviklingen i sektoren har vidtr\u00e6kkende konsekvenser \u2013 b\u00e5de for klima, samfund og \u00f8konomi. Samtidig viser Circularity Gap Report, at Danmark kun er fire procent cirkul\u00e6r og ligger langt under b\u00e5de EU og globale niveauer. Hvis alle levede som danskerne, ville det kr\u00e6ve ressourcer fra fire planeter. Bygge- og anl\u00e6gssektoren er med andre ord b\u00e5de en del af problemet og n\u00f8glen til l\u00f8sningen.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nEt missionsdrevet partnerskab Heldigvis har branchen de seneste \u00e5r demonstreret b\u00e5de vilje og evne til forandring. Danske forskningsmilj\u00f8er, virksomheder og organisationer har udviklet viden og teknologier, der reelt kan g\u00f8re en forskel. If\u00f8lge rapporten fra Byggeriets Handletank for B\u00e6redygtighed forventes byggeriets globale CO2-aftryk af falde med cirka 50 procent i perioden 2021-2030 med eksisterende tiltag og cirka 60 procent samlet set, hvis handletankens anbefalinger implementeres. Men n\u00e5r blikket rettes mod 2050 og de langsigtede klimam\u00e5l mod klimaneutralitet, bliver det klart, at der skal yderligere tiltag til. De sidste 40 procent af de n\u00f8dvendige reduktioner kr\u00e6ver en m\u00e5lrettet og samlet indsats. Det kr\u00e6ver politisk vilje og mod til at prioritere omr\u00e5det \u2013 og sikre, at bygge- og anl\u00e6gssektoren huskes, n\u00e5r forskningsreservens midler fordeles. Mette Glavind, Rasmus Brandt Lassen, m.fl.\n\nSe alle indl\u00e6ggets afsendere i faktaboksen Vi foresl\u00e5r et missionsdrevet partnerskab eller et \u201cByggeriets Udviklings- og Demonstrationsprogram\u201d (BUDP), ligesom der allerede findes et Energiteknologisk Udviklings- og Demonstrationsprogram (EUDP) og et Milj\u00f8teknologisk Udviklings- og Demonstrationsprogram (MUDP). Med en f\u00e6lles mission eller et f\u00e6lles program for byggeriet vil universiteter, GTS-institutter, virksomheder og offentlige akt\u00f8rer sammen kunne udvikle, teste og implementere nye l\u00f8sninger. Et missionsdrevet partnerskab eller en \u201cBUPD\u201d vil kunne samle eksisterende initiativer som for eksempel Byggeriets Handletank for B\u00e6redygtighed og Reduction Roadmap. Temaerne b\u00f8r inkludere forskning og innovation inden for s\u00e5vel gr\u00f8n omstilling af traditionelle byggematerialer, brug af biobaserede og cirkul\u00e6re byggematerialer, transformation af eksisterende bygningsmasse, optimering af processer gennem digitalisering og AI samt \u00f8get cirkularitet og biodiversitet i hele v\u00e6rdik\u00e6den. Bygge- og anl\u00e6gsbranchen er kompleks og pr\u00e6get af mange sm\u00e5 og mellemstore virksomheder, hvilket g\u00f8r det n\u00f8dvendigt at samle kr\u00e6fterne og \u00f8rem\u00e6rke forsknings- og innovationsmidler til netop denne sektor.

      "text": "Elissama Menezes and Andrew Dumbrille, directors of Equal Routes, write for Splash ahead of this month\u2019s crunch green vote at the International Maritime Organization.\n\nIn the face of the upcoming International Maritime Organization. (IMO) Net-Zero Framework vote next month, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rhetoric around the so-called LNG pathway, yet little substance.\n\nRecent commentary from IMO leadership and key industry players, including classification societies, has ignited a specious debate about the role of LNG as a \u201ctransition\u201d fuel. Commercial interests from DNV and ABS \u2013 the latter running its own LNG Academy \u2013 are blatantly clear as they attempt to use their industry influence to sell LNG as a viable pathway.\n\nBut let us be clear with you, LNG, in any shape or form, cannot be a solution for shipping. The IMO must recognise this in the guidelines that still need to be negotiated over the coming months, and that will shape the framework before it enters into action in 2027.\n\nThe reason why is simple: methane.\n\nThe reality is that methane emissions from ships fuelled by LNG increased 180% between 2016 and 2023. Research repeatedly shows that methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas \u2013 is incompatible with the shipping sector\u2019s decarbonisation goals. Regardless of the source of LNG (fossil, bio-LNG, e-LNG), methane still leaks through the entire lifecycle of this fuel \u2013 from extraction and processing to storage and use at sea. Industry continues to tout \u201cinnovative\u201d technological solutions that will address methane slip with poor science underpinning these claims.\n\nThe 180% sharp rise in methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships is a massive public health concern. Methane is globally linked to 1.04 to 1.23 million respiratory-related deaths annually among adults over 30 and a higher risk of various cardiovascular diseases. Physicians have been sounding the alarm, as the consequences of LNG expansion do not stay within the confines of the shipping sector. At the local level, LNG exposes frontline communities to harmful pollutants, contaminates water sources, and strains under-resourced healthcare systems. False promises have propped up LNG all along\n\nThe cost advantage reinforced by the industry\u2019s short-term cost optimisation strategies is expected to sustain the increase of LNG-fuelled ships unless governments step in with clear policies to counter this trend. Despite robust demand projections, the LNG market is grappling with structural challenges. It is reasonable to expect that not all newbuilding contracts will be completed, and instead, see the pivot away from LNG to electrification continue to take place. Shipowners will inevitably confront either costly retrofits, with the latest available research estimating \u00a3113bn ($152m) to \u00a3185bn in losses investing in an LNG-capable fleet, or the early recycling of LNG-powered vessels \u2013 both carrying significant financial and environmental burdens. What may seem like a short-term economic strategy risks leaving the sector with a costly legacy of prematurely obsolete ships.\n\nThe path is clear: there is no space in the IMO Net-Zero Framework for LNG. What we need instead has been clearly articulated by the Marshall Islands, Mexico, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, and the civil society at the IMO.\n\nFirst, the IMO must align shipping\u2019s climate ambition with the 1.5 degree climate-warming pathway and the principles of a just and equitable transition.\n\nSecondly, governments must ensure alignment and coherence among all three policy elements that are critical to make the IMO strategy work: a carbon intensity measure, a global fuel standard, and a GHG pricing system. These must be guided by life cycle assessment (LCA) guidelines based on the well-to-wake principle.\n\nFinally, the correspondence group on \u2018other social and economic sustainability aspects of marine fuels\u2019 within the LCA guidelines must be re-established to send a strong signal that the IMO is serious about applying the well-to-wake principle across its GHG framework.\n\nSpecial attention must also be paid to the land rights of Indigenous and rural communities, as well as the risks to biodiversity, water, and food security that come with land-use change. Embedding these human rights and ecosystem perspectives in the LCA guidelines would ensure that assessments of new marine fuels put people and nature at the centre.\n\nOnce the IMO applies this comprehensive life-cycle approach under the framework\u2019s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels \u2013 LNG, biomethane, and e-methane \u2013 cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives, exposing the industry\u2019s rhetoric for what it is: false promises that have propped up LNG all along.",

      "text": "By Mark Chediak and Jennifer A. Dlouhy (Bloomberg) \u2014 The Trump administration told a federal court it intends to reconsider a key US government approval that authorized the construction of Equinor ASA\u2019s planned second phase of an offshore wind project near New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management will review the approved construction and operations plan for the Empire Wind 2 project, the US said in a Tuesday filing with a Washington-based federal district court considering a legal challenge to the project by area residents and businesses. Equinor didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe move is part of a broader campaign by President Donald Trump against the nascent US offshore wind industry, after years deriding the energy source and casting it as part of a \u201cgreen energy scam.\u201d His administration has stopped new offshore wind leasing and permitting, is moving to revoke existing authorizations and has halted projects under construction.\n\nThe government said its plan is consistent with a broad offshore wind review Trump ordered just hours after his January inauguration. It\u2019s also aligned with an ongoing Interior Department assessment of the extent to which past offshore wind project approvals comply with a decades-old federal law that requires energy projects on coastal federal waters balance a dozen different needs, including protecting the environment and national security as well as preventing interference with use of the high seas.\n\nAn Equinor spokesperson said Wednesday that the company doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation. However, an Equinor executive said on Bloomberg TV in July that the Norwegian company is unlikely to pursue the Empire Wind 2 project, which hasn\u2019t started construction, because of regulatory changes in the US.\n\nThe US filing was focused on Empire Wind 2, and the government didn\u2019t outline any plans to similarly review key permits for the nearly built Empire Wind 1 venture.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration briefly halted construction on Empire Wind 1 earlier this year, it allowed work to resume after Governor Kathy Hochul signaled New York wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of new energy projects.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "September 2025 saw just 14 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels, according to data from DNV\u2019s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform. Of these, 12 were LNG-fuelled vessels, primarily from the container segment (6), with additional orders from bulk carrier (4) and cruise (2) segments. The remaining two orders were for LPG carriers.\n\nThe first nine months of 2025 have recorded 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels, marking a significant 48% decline compared to the same period in 2024. LNG remains the dominant alternative fuel choice with 121 orders, followed by methanol (43), LPG carriers (19), ammonia (5), and hydrogen (4).\n\nThe container segment continues to lead the transition, accounting for 63% of all new orders in 2025 with 120 vessels.\n\nJason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime, points to a clear slowdown in the market: \u201cFollowing a record-breaking first half of the year, zero new orders in August and relatively low activity in September signal a clear slowdown in the alternative-fuelled market in the third quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this trend reflects a weaker overall newbuild market and rising contracting costs, other factors are also influencing sentiment,\u201d Stefanatos added.\n\nThe director specifically highlighted regulatory uncertainty as a key factor: \u201cUncertainties around the IMO\u2019s Net-Zero Framework, including lifecycle assessment factors for certain fuels, are prompting many owners to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach to new orders. It is, therefore, essential that the industry receives greater regulatory clarity in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThis current slowdown contrasts sharply with the first half of 2025, which saw orders for alternative-fuelled ships reach 19.8 million gross tonnes (GT), a 78% increase compared to the same period in 2024. While the total number of vessels ordered (151) was slightly lower than the 179 ordered in H1 2024, the substantial increase in gross tonnage revealed a focus on larger vessels adopting cleaner fuel technologies.\n\nThe maritime industry now faces additional uncertainty with a pivotal vote at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) this month. The IMO\u2019s Net Zero Framework, if adopted, would be the first global regime to pair mandatory emissions caps with greenhouse gas pricing across the entire industry. The plan, set to take effect in 2027, would introduce steep penalties for ships that miss fuel-efficiency targets.",

      "text": "By Julian Lee\n\nOct 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) \u2013Russia\u2019s ability to divert its crude to the global market is diminishing fast as the nation\u2019s oil refineries come under attack from Ukrainian drones.\n\nSince the start of August, Ukraine has targeted at least 15 refineries across the European part of Russia. Some of the drone assaults succeeded, with Russian refinery runs falling below 5 million barrels a day, according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase & Co. That means about 500,000 barrels a day of processing have been curtailed, based on historic data.\n\nThe strikes haven\u2019t drawn the same criticism from the US or the European Union that greeted attacks on Russian energy infrastructure when Joe Biden was US president. Western powers see targeting Russia oil revenues as crucial. However, there may be some nervousness in Washington and Brussels if the global supply of petroleum starts to become constrained.\n\nWhile the attacks have coincided with a ramp up in the Moscow\u2019s seaborne crude sales \u2014 suggesting some cargo diversion could already be underway \u2014 a review of the nation\u2019s peak export flows suggests there\u2019s limited scope for them to go much higher.\n\nTwo of the three ports that are most likely to handle barrels from disrupted refineries \u2014 Primorsk in the Baltic, and Novorossiysk in the Black Sea \u2014 are now close to their upper limits. Both are now shipping close to the largest number of barrels on a four-week rolling basis in 18 months.\n\nAnd while the third \u2014 Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic \u2014 has nominal capacity to export more, its shipments all year have been stuck well below their peak, set back in October 2024. It\u2019s not clear why, although it\u2019s notable that Ukraine has repeatedly targeted pumping stations on the pipelines that feed the port.\n\nIf Russia\u2019s overall sales of hydrocarbons are curtailed, it may have a greater incentive to discourage its partners within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost supply to global markets. The group meets on Sunday to discuss its next production decision.\n\nBased on peak shipments since the war in Ukraine began, Ust-Luga should have about 235,000 barrels a day of spare capacity. Based on this year\u2019s shipments, that figure would be closer to 130,000.\n\nIt implies that the three western ports that can realistically handle diverted barrels have about 165,000 to 265,000 barrels a day of spare capacity between them.\n\nOther Ports\n\nRussia also has crude-export outlets in the Arctic and the Pacific oceans, but these are less likely to be useful if crude has to be diverted from damaged refineries.\n\nThe one major port that so far appears to have been immune to attack and may physically be able to take some diverted crude from Siberian oil fields is Kozmino on Russia\u2019s Pacific coast. Served by both the ESPO pipeline and a rail link from Siberia, the terminal can handle more than 1 million barrels a day.\n\nThe problem for Moscow is that it\u2019s already operating close to capacity and winter is approaching, when storms and freezing temperatures have previously hampered operations for several days at a time.\n\nOther key Pacific ports \u2014 De Kastri and Prigorodnoye \u2014 are linked directly to the Sakhalin 1 and 2 oil projects. They can\u2019t handle crude from elsewhere.\n\nIn the Arctic, the Murmansk oil terminal is also disconnected from Russia\u2019s pipeline system. It is used to build up cargoes from several projects along the country\u2019s north coast operated by Lukoil PJSC and Gazprom Neft PJSC. Export rates from the port are linked directly to the production from those fields.\n\nThat may rise in the coming weeks, with flows typically curtailed by maintenance work during the warmer summer months. But Murmansk wouldn\u2019t offer a means to divert crude from damaged refineries.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

The tribunal found that liability lay with the state rather than PDSA, leaving DP World\u2019s $1bn claims against Djibouti and China Merchants still active.\n\nDP World is also owed $685m in earlier arbitration awards against the government, which remain unpaid. \u201cDjibouti\u2019s claims are at odds with reality, proven time and again in independent international tribunals,\u201d a DP World spokesperson said, adding: \u201cThis case is bigger than DP World \u2014 it is about whether governments can tear up binding contracts and ignore international law without consequence.\u201d\n\nThe Doraleh Container Terminal, which handles 1.2m teu a year, is often described as the largest and most modern container facility in East Africa. DP World said that under its management, it accounted for about 12% of Djibouti\u2019s GDP and provided thousands of jobs.\n\nDjibouti maintained the seizure was lawful, a position rejected by multiple rulings. President Ismail Omar Guelleh recently defended the government\u2019s actions in a video statement, but DP World insisted the narrative misrepresents the facts.\n\nThe conflict dates back to 2018, when Djibouti terminated DP World\u2019s concession secured in 2006 and partnered with China Merchants. DP World has since pursued legal remedies through international tribunals.",

      "text": "What do we want to achieve ?\n\nEurope's transport system has been a huge success, connecting people across the continent and reducing journey times. As we have all become more mobile, so the carbon footprint of our transport activities has grown. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions and this figure continues to rise as demand grows. The European Green Deal seeks a 90% reduction in these emissions by 2050. Moving to more sustainable transport means putting users first and providing them with more affordable, accessible, healthier and cleaner alternatives.\n\nA key objective is to boost considerably the uptake of clean vehicles and alternative fuels. By 2025, about 1 million public recharging and refuelling stations will be needed for the 13 million zero- and low-emission vehicles expected on European roads. The Commission is supporting and financing the deployment of recharging and refuelling points where persistent gaps exist, notably for long-distance travel and less densely populated areas.\n\nAchieving the ambitious climate goals also requires a shift to more sustainable transport modes such as rail and inland waterways. For this to happen, the capacity of both modes will need to be both extended and better managed.\n\nMultimodal transport \u2013 the combining of various transport modes throughout a journey \u2013 can also increase the use of sustainable transport modes, but needs a strong boost. The Combined Transport Directive is important here \u2013 it is designed to support multimodal freight operations involving rail and waterborne transport, including short-sea shipping.\n\nImproving efficiency across the whole transport system is crucial. Digital technologies enabling automated mobility and smart traffic management systems, for example, will help with efficiency while also making transport cleaner. Smart applications and \u2018Mobility as a Service' solutions will also play an important role. In aviation, the Single European Sky initiative should significantly reduce aviation emissions at zero cost to consumers and companies by reducing flight times.\n\nThe negative environmental and health costs of transport \u2013 also known as externalities \u2013 are not generally reflected in prices. To rectify this, the Commission envisages extending emissions trading to the maritime sector and reducing the EU Emissions Trading System allowances currently allocated to airlines for free. This will be coordinated with action at global level, notably at the International Civil Aviation Organization (through CORSIA) and the International Maritime Organization. Other EU action in support of the \u2018polluter-pays' principle includes effective road pricing in the EU, as well as ending subsidies for fossil fuel.\n\nIt is in cities that pollution is felt the most. A combination of measures is needed to address air quality, emissions, urban congestion and noise. These include improving public transport and promoting active modes of transport such as walking and cycling. The EU will pay particular attention to reducing pollution in EU ports as well as the pollutants emitted by aeroplanes and airport operations.\n\nThe Commission supports the transition to sustainable mobility through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Committed to spending 60% of the budget on infrastructure projects with a link to sustainability, CEF will be important in creating a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels, and in enabling a highly performing, interoperable European railway network.\n\nThe ReFuelEU Aviation initiative launched on 14 July 2021 contains an obligation on airlines to uplift SAF-blended aviation fuel when departing from EU airports. And at the same time, it introduces an obligation on fuel suppliers to include increasing shares of SAF into jet fuel from 2025 to 2050. These EU-wide harmonised rules for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) will apply to all operators and therefore ensure a level-playing field.\n\nMore information\n\nGreen Deal - communication\n\nFactsheet",

This session explores the primary barriers and challenges faced in the public procurement of these services.\n\nWe delve into effective strategies such as Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI), along with EU programmes that can facilitate the deployment and scaling of innovations.\n\nThrough case studies from cities that have successfully implemented these strategies, participants will gain a practical insight into adopting mobility innovation. These examples aim to inspire local authorities across the EU to overcome challenges and enhance their mobility services.\n\nPanel discussion:\n\nAija L\u0101ce , Project Manager, VEFRESH\n\n, Project Manager, VEFRESH Erdem Ovacik , Founder, Impact Exchange Market\n\n, Founder, Impact Exchange Market Marc Rozendal , CEO, EIT Urban Mobility\n\n, CEO, EIT Urban Mobility Line Camilla Werner, Head of Legal, RUTER\n\nModerator: Thomas Lymes, Policy Director, Eurocities\n\nRoom: Zeta\n\n12:45-13:45\n\nLunch break\n\n13:45-15:00\n\nPlenary: Unlocking the potential of urban cycling: from policy to practice\n\nCycling shouldn\u2019t be considered a lifestyle choice when it has the potential to be a key pillar of sustainable urban mobility. But what does it take to make cycling a fully-fledged means of transport? What can Europe\u2019s innovative cycling sector do to help ensure cycling is integrated seamlessly into city infrastructure and urban logistics?\n\nAs progress on the European Declaration on Cycling takes centre stage, we explore how data-driven planning, investment and policy can improve cycling conditions, tackle transport poverty, improve people\u2019s health, increase the competitiveness of the cycling industry and boost sustainable tourism in city destinations.\n\nPanel discussion:\n\nMagda Kopczy\u0144ska , Director-General, Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE), European Commission\n\n, Director-General, Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE), European Commission Gintar\u0117 Janu\u0161aitien\u0117 , Head of Sustainable Mobility and Innovation Group, Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Lithuania\n\n, Head of Sustainable Mobility and Innovation Group, Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Lithuania Anna Lisa Boni , Deputy Mayor for EU/Recovery funds, Ecological Transition and International Relations, City of Bologna\n\n, Deputy Mayor for EU/Recovery funds, Ecological Transition and International Relations, City of Bologna Laurianne Kridd , CEO, European Cyclists' Federation (ECF)\n\n, CEO, European Cyclists' Federation (ECF) Anastasiia Makarenko, Ukrainian Civil Society Activist, Executive Director of U-Cycle (Kyiv Cyclists' Association NGO), Co-Coordinator of the International Humanitarian Campaign \u201cBikes For Ukraine\u201d\n\nModerator: Karen Vancluysen, Secretary General, POLIS\n\nRoom: Alfa\n\n15:15-16:30\n\nCycling at the forefront of the Climate-Neutral Cities Mission\n\nCycling as a daily travel mode has huge potential to tackle carbon emissions. By prioritising cycling, cities address multiple issues at once and reduce congestion, open up public space and green areas, and improve residents\u2019 health through reduced noise and air pollution, plus the additional benefit of an active lifestyle.\n\nIn this session, we hear from several Mission Cities that are implementing cycling plans as part of their efforts to achieve net zero and improve public health.\n\nPanel discussion:\n\nAndrius Grigonis , Vice Mayor of Vilnius\n\n, Vice Mayor of Vilnius Francoise Guaspare , Representation of \u00cele-de-France to the European Union, Ile-de-France and Co-Leader of the Expert Group on Urban Mobility (EGUM)\n\n, Representation of \u00cele-de-France to the European Union, Ile-de-France and Co-Leader of the Expert Group on Urban Mobility (EGUM) Stefana Hoti , First Deputy Mayor and Commissioner for Urban Planning, Malm\u00f6 Stad, Sweden\n\n, First Deputy Mayor and Commissioner for Urban Planning, Malm\u00f6 Stad, Sweden Barbara Stoll, Founder and Senior Director of the Clean Cities Campaign, Transport & Environment (T&E)\n\nModerator: Keji Alex Adunmo, Policy Coordinator, Sustainable Mobility, Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE), European Commission\n\nRoom: Alfa\n\nThe bicycle industry in Europe: strengthening competitiveness through innovation\n\nWe share some key statistics on the state of the European bicycle industry. A change in mobility patterns led to an increase in the number of cyclists and to an increase in bicycle sales in Europe, rising from 19 million in 2000 to 22 million in 2020. Studies indicate that the European bicycle industry could continue to grow steadily year on year to 2030. However, the industry has experienced significant challenges in recent years.\n\nThis session seeks to understand how innovation can help the bicycle industry overcome these challenges and become more resilient and competitive. What does it mean to invest in innovation in the bicycle industry? Can the cycling industry change gears and raise demand for the bicycle as a transport mode in its own right?\n\nPanel discussion:\n\nRonald Jorna , Self-Employed Consultant, MOVECO & Province of Overijssel\n\n, Self-Employed Consultant, MOVECO & Province of Overijssel Friederike Pischnick , Political Affairs and Government Relations, Bosch GmbH\n\n, Political Affairs and Government Relations, Bosch GmbH Koen Tengrootenhuysen , Director Public Affairs Europe, Decathlon\n\n, Director Public Affairs Europe, Decathlon Paul Walsh, CEO, Cycling Industries Europe (CIE)\n\nModerator: Giacomo Lozzi, Independent Advisor \u2013 Urban Mobility Policy and Innovation\n\nRoom: Beta\n\nReinventing cycling: the perspective of women\n\nCycling, whether on our streets or in industry and sport, is often considered to be a male-dominated domain. This can have a negative impact on efforts to improve cycling in cities, where urban planners nonetheless need to take into consideration the travel needs of the whole population.\n\nThis session delves into what gets women cycling. What are the benefits for everyone if more women feel empowered to go by bike? What are the specific needs and preferences when it comes to safety, infrastructure and bicycles? Key female figures from the cycling industry and the world of politics engage in this insightful discussion.\n\nPanel discussion:\n\nJulienne Chen , Head of City Partnerships, EIT Urban Mobility\n\n, Head of City Partnerships, EIT Urban Mobility Andreia Lopes Azevedo , Active Travel & Health Cluster Lead, POLIS\n\n, Active Travel & Health Cluster Lead, POLIS April Marshke , Founder, Outside Advice Consulting\n\n, Founder, Outside Advice Consulting Maud de Vries, CEO, BYCS\n\nModerator: Philip Amaral, Director of Policy and Development, European Cyclists' Federation (ECF)\n\nRoom: Zeta\n\n16:30-17:15\n\nCoffee break\n\n17:15-18:30\n\nEU digital wallets and urban mobility\n\nThe Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy identified paperless transport as one of the 2030 milestones, and refers to digital certificates for drivers and vehicles, contactless payments for parking and tolls, and better information on urban vehicle access regulations.\n\nThis session explores the potential of EU digital wallets in the domain of urban mobility.
