Og netop her ser en vingeskudt branche muligheder.\n\n\u201cDet er ikke i forsvarsindustrien, vi kan have den st\u00f8rste betydning, men hvis vi kan bruge den som l\u00f8ftestang til at drive klimaomstillingen, ville det v\u00e6re et stort skridt,\u201d fremh\u00e6vede Michael Petersen, senior vice president i Everllence, i denne uge til en debat om forsvarsindustriens muligheder med s\u00e5kaldte e-fuels.\n\nAnledningen var, at en af Europas st\u00f8rste konferencer for den hidtil s\u00e5 lovende industri for brint og andre s\u00e5kaldte e-fuels fandt sted i K\u00f8benhavn. Og mens fort\u00e6llingen p\u00e5 gangene i Bella Center og fra scenerne handlede om lukkede projekter og langtrukne projektplaner, antog h\u00e5bet gr\u00f8nnere nuancer under forsvarsdebatten.\n\nGr\u00f8nne nuancer\n\n\u201cDet kan b\u00e5de v\u00e6re milj\u00f8m\u00e6ssigt lysegr\u00f8nt, milit\u00e6rt m\u00f8rkegr\u00f8nt og skabe udvikling,\u201d l\u00f8d slagordet eksempelvis fra adm. direkt\u00f8r i Arcadia e-Fuels Martin Nielsen.\n\nHer henviser han til, at teknologierne under e-fuels-paraplyen samtidig skaber arbejdspladser i omr\u00e5der, der har brug for det \u2013 Arcadia er etableret i Vordingborg.\n\nArcadia er et af de projekter, der over de senere \u00e5r er dukket op i en spirende industri for alternative br\u00e6ndstoffer til alt fra skibe til fly og tung vejtransport. Tilf\u00e6lles har e-fuels, at de er skabt p\u00e5 fabrikker, der omdanner elektricitet til flydende br\u00e6ndsler som metanol eller \u00e6tanol.\n\nSelv om processen kr\u00e6ver megen energi og endnu ikke er i n\u00e6rheden af det sp\u00e5ede potentiale, har det hidtil v\u00e6ret klimadagsordenen, der drev br\u00e6ndslerne frem, da gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m p\u00e5 denne m\u00e5de kan fodres til de industrier, der har brug for flydende br\u00e6ndsler.\n\n\u201cVores produkter kan ogs\u00e5 bruges til milit\u00e6re form\u00e5l uden problemer. Det kan nemt v\u00e6re \u2018dual use\u2019 og kan leveres uden \u00e6ndringer overhovedet,\u201d siger Martin Nielsen.\n\nSelv om forsvarsindustriens fokus ikke hidtil har v\u00e6ret i gr\u00f8n omstilling, har teknologierne nemlig en anden nyttig effekt: selvforsyning og dermed \u00f8get forsyningssikkerhed, p\u00e5peger senior vice president i European Energy Hans Brask.\n\n\u201cDet er vigtigt, at vi diskuterer mulighederne og str\u00e6ber efter at have vores egne br\u00e6ndstoffer, ikke blot til den maritime sektor, men ogs\u00e5 til luftfart,\u201d siger han.\n\nTidligere kontreadmiral og chef for s\u00f8v\u00e6rnet Torben Mikkelsen er i dag r\u00e5dgiver i Nationalt Forsvarsteknologisk Center, hvor han arbejder med udvikling af fremtidens fl\u00e5defart\u00f8jer.\n\nHan peger p\u00e5, at mange metoder i forsvaret er pr\u00e6get af gammelkendt teknologi, hvorfor der er gode muligheder for nyt\u00e6nkning.\n\nSom et eksempel peger han p\u00e5 de hybridmotorer, der allerede er installeret p\u00e5 danske f\u00e6rger i dag, som en mulighed for milit\u00e6re fart\u00f8jer, der alligevel f\u00e6rdes i de samme farvande.\n\n\u201cSk\u00f8nheden ved elektrisk fremdrift er, at den er meget stille. Hvis du vil bek\u00e6mpe ub\u00e5de, vil du gerne v\u00e6re stille. Hvis du er interesseret i ikke at blive s\u00e6nket af en ub\u00e5d, vil du gerne v\u00e6re stille,\u201d siger han.\n\n\u201cDer er mange operationelle fordele ved at t\u00e6nke forskellige fremdriftssystemer ind i krigsskibe,\u201d p\u00e5peger han.\n\nHer fremh\u00e6ver han, at det b\u00e5de kan g\u00e6lde e-fuels, batterier eller s\u00e5gar kernekraft.\n\nKr\u00e6ver tillid\n\nDer er imidlertid ogs\u00e5 helt nye hensyn, der skal tages, n\u00e5r teknologier skal udnyttes i forsvaret, understreger Torben Mikkelsen.\n\n\u201cMan bliver for eksempel n\u00f8dt til at t\u00e6nke mere p\u00e5 br\u00e6ndstoffernes flammepunkt. Der er lidt anderledes hensyn, n\u00e5r truslen mod skibet er et missil. S\u00e5 har du m\u00e5ske en anden business case, end hvis du bare sejler fra havn til havn,\u201d konstaterer den tidligere kontreadmiral.\n\nNetop derfor vurderer Hans Brask i European Energy ogs\u00e5, at forsvaret har en tendens til at v\u00e6re serviceret af de leverand\u00f8rer, der kender sektoren godt i forvejen.\n\n\u201cVi er nytilkomne i sektoren, s\u00e5 vi har brug for at opbygge tillid, og vi har brug for at v\u00e6re konkrete og vise, at vi forst\u00e5r rammerne. Samtidig skal de stole p\u00e5, at du eksisterer de n\u00e6ste par \u00e5r,\u201d konstaterer han, med henvisning til sektoren, hvor projekter og virksomheder udskiftes.\n\n\u201cH\u00e6ren kommer ikke til at ringe til mig i morgen og sige: \u2018Vi har et problem. Kan du l\u00f8se det?\u2019\u201d vurderer han og peger p\u00e5 forsvarets droneproblemer som eksempel.",

      "text": "As the IMO prepares to decide shipping\u2019s most consequential climate measure in decades, a rare show of unity from leading shipowner associations faces opposition from the likes of John Fredriksen, Greek giants, leading class societies and Washington.\n\nWith days to go before the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) extraordinary session on the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a deep rift has emerged across the shipping industry.\n\nSeven leading shipowner associations \u2013 from Japan, Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands and Singapore \u2013 have just issued a joint appeal urging governments to \u201cmake history in London\u201d by approving the global decarbonisation plan \u2014 even as powerful opposition gathers from some of the sector\u2019s most influential players.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would be a major milestone for global climate regulation,\u201d the associations declared in a joint statement released this week. \u201cAnything else would be a major setback for the green transition and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations.\u201d\n\nThe statement argues that the IMO\u2019s framework \u2014 years in the making \u2014 is essential to provide predictability for investors and to scale up production of alternative fuels.\n\n\u201cOur industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation \u2013 also to address climate change,\u201d said the signatories.\n\n\u201cThe alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks that would derail the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition.\u201d\n\nThe framework, due for a final vote next week, would set a global carbon levy and fuel standard aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. It would also establish a central Net Zero Fund to reward compliance and finance green infrastructure.\n\nWhile backing the framework\u2019s ambition, global tanker organisation INTERTANKO this week called for a more measured approach to implementation.\n\n\u201cThe framework will create certainty, allowing shipowners and operators to focus on operational feasibility without the burden of regional unpredictability,\u201d said Emma Scheiris, INTERTANKO\u2019s deputy director for environment.\n\nScheiris warned, however, that the debate had become \u201cpolarised\u201d and that the IMO must ensure \u201call transitional pathways remain in place for the long-term shift to zero- and near-zero fuels.\u201d\n\nShe listed several unresolved technical hurdles: the absence of a global sustainable fuels certification scheme, the need for sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, and clear crediting for non-fuel energy sources such as wind propulsion.\n\n\u201cWhile maintaining the Polluter Pays principle, we need to provide the required investment security to unlock capital for a decarbonised future,\u201d Scheiris said. \u201cBeyond compliance, this is about establishing a framework that enables the maritime industry to accelerate toward zero-GHG shipping.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is onboard. A powerful bloc of major shipowners \u2014 including John Fredriksen\u2019s Frontline, George Economou\u2019s TMS Group, Evangelos Marinakis\u2019s Capital Maritime, the Angelicoussis Group, and Saudi state carrier Bahri \u2014 has come out against the deal in its current form, warning it could \u201cimpose excessive financial burdens on the industry and consumers.\u201d\n\nThe opposition, coordinated during London International Shipping Week last month, also includes Dynacom, GasLog, Seapeak, and Stolt Tankers. Together, they represent a significant share of the global tanker and gas carrier fleet.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, we do not believe the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonising the maritime industry nor ensure a level playing field as intended,\u201d the group stated, calling for \u201ccritical amendments\u201d before adoption.\n\nGreek shipping minister Vassilis Kikilias echoed their concerns, telling IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez in London that \u201cchanges are essential\u201d before the framework can be accepted.\n\nDominguez, however, struck a confident tone at the same event. \u201cI remain convinced the framework will be adopted,\u201d he told delegates. \u201cI base that on the track record of the organisation, on the co-operation that we all have, and the understanding that we still have some challenges and concerns.\u201d\n\nThe IMO rarely resorts to formal voting, but sources in London say a ballot looks increasingly likely. If consensus cannot be reached, adoption will require a two-thirds majority \u2014 108 of the 176 member states that have ratified MARPOL Annex VI.\n\nThe Getting to Zero Coalition, representing more than 180 companies and several of the world\u2019s largest shipowners, last month issued a statement calling on member states to adopt the framework without delay.\n\n\u201cProlonged uncertainty could put very large investments \u2014 ones that will be critical for the future of global trade \u2014 at risk,\u201d the coalition said. \u201cThe absence of global regulatory guidance will raise the costs of change in the long run \u2014 costs that the industry, countries, and consumers will bear.\u201d\n\nPatrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), also urged IMO members to seize the moment.\n\n\u201cA failure to adopt the framework would create absolute investment uncertainty,\u201d Verhoeven warned. \u201cAchieving IMO\u2019s net zero targets would become impossible.\u201d\n\nAdding to the tension, the US remains firmly opposed to the framework. Washington walked out of April\u2019s MEPC session and has since warned that countries supporting the deal could face retaliatory measures ranging from tariffs to port levies and visa restrictions.\n\nAnalysts say the vote could hinge on a small number of undecided states \u2014 including several from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America \u2014 where political and economic alignments are in flux.\n\nSplash will be bringing readers details of all the key outcomes from the IMO meet-up next week.",

      "text": "Shipping\u2019s decarbonisation drive won\u2019t be defined by one big breakthrough, according to Mikko Kuosa, CEO of Finland-based software company NAPA. Instead, the focus is shifting to combining proven technologies and tailoring solutions to fit specific vessel types and trades.\n\n\u201cThere will not be a single silver-bullet solution,\u201d Kuosa tells Maritime CEO. \u201cDifferent permutation and combinations of technologies will prove optimal in different scenarios.\u201d\n\nShort-sea shipping is seeing battery-powered vessels coming online. For deep-sea, hybrid setups are gaining traction, including wind-assisted propulsion. Kuosa points to a recent simulation run by NAPA, Norsepower and Sumitomo that showed emissions could be cut by up to 28% when wind power is paired with voyage optimisation.\n\nDesign-stage simulation is also coming into its own. Shipyards like HD Hyundai and Chantiers de l\u2019Atlantique are using digital twins to model real-world fuel use, hydrodynamics, emissions, and even crew workflow before a single section is welded. Kuosa says this shift helps ensure that \u201cships entering the water are already greener, safer and optimized for real-world performance.\u201d\n\nIntegration is what\u2019s driving all this forward. \u201cThe future will favour solutions that connect data, technology and people seamlessly. That\u2019s where the breakthroughs will be most visible,\u201d he says.\n\nAI is already playing a key role in NAPA\u2019s offering. It\u2019s being used to analyse hull fouling, predict CII ratings, and refine fuel efficiency. \u201cIn performance monitoring, we use it to analyze hull fouling, predict CII ratings for specific voyages, and model fuel efficiency with remarkable precision,\u201d Kuosa explains.\n\nIt\u2019s also being applied to ship safety and port navigation. \u201cWe\u2019ve integrated AI into our ship stability and loading software, automatically optimising cargo placement in line with the IMDG code and sending alerts to prevent hazardous misplacement,\u201d he says. The same technology is being used to process AIS data more accurately than ever.\n\n\u201cThese advances aren\u2019t about replacing human judgment; they\u2019re about supporting the crews and shoreside teams with better tools,\u201d Kuosa adds.\n\nBut the next leap in AI will only come once the industry cleans up its data. \u201cShipping\u2019s fragmented data systems mean we don\u2019t yet have the structured, interconnected data required to unlock the next wave of AI innovation,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce our industry establishes strong data hygiene, the floodgates of innovation will surely open.\u201d\n\nNAPA is positioning itself at the centre of this ecosystem. With tools covering everything from early-stage design to daily operations, the company is creating continuous feedback loops that allow lessons from one vessel to inform the design and performance of the next. \u201cOperational data from one ship can improve the design of the next, and even after a vessel is retired, its operational data can live on to inform future fleets,\u201d Kuosa says.\n\nOn the commercial side, the industry is finally starting to put serious money behind technology. \u201cThe cost of inaction is rapidly becoming greater than the cost of innovation,\u201d says Kuosa. Wind propulsion is no longer experimental\u2014installations have doubled in two years. Voyage optimisation, once a fringe tool, is now a board-level discussion.\n\n\u201cDigital logbooks, for instance, have moved from trial projects to fleet-wide rollouts. It\u2019s not just efficiency; it\u2019s risk reduction and improved compliance discipline,\u201d he says. But there\u2019s still ground to cover. \u201cThe penny has dropped, but it\u2019s still rolling. The next few years will determine whether companies pick it up and invest, or watch competitors move ahead without them.\u201d\n\nInternally, NAPA is shifting its own talent base, bringing in new technical roles and focusing more heavily on customer-centric design. \u201cWe don\u2019t just build software \u2013 we design solutions around the full customer journey,\u201d says Kuosa.\n\nExternally, the company is pushing collaboration hard. NAPA Studios, the firm\u2019s innovation and co-creation platform, is working with shipowners, yards, class, and even financiers. \u201cThese are not problems any single company can solve in isolation,\u201d Kuosa notes. One example: a digital twin initiative involving 13 of Japan\u2019s largest shipping firms, aiming to build a secure data-sharing model between shipyards and operators.\n\nKuosa is also clear on one thing: no digital transition will succeed if it adds to the already heavy burden on crews. \u201cSuccess depends on seafarers and shoreside teams\u2014and they are under growing strain,\u201d he says. Citing research showing mental health issues and increased workloads among senior officers, he argues that tech must ease the load, not add to it.\n\nNAPA\u2019s digital logbook has cut admin time by 2,000 hours per vessel per year for operators like Anthony Veder. Smart checklists and a digital Permit to Work tool\u2014trialled with Carnival and Virgin Voyages\u2014are now part of the company\u2019s broader effort to improve safety and reduce complexity.\n\n\u201cThe goal is simple: reduce manual effort, minimize compliance risk, and give crews and companies the clarity they need to navigate the transition safely and sustainably,\u201d Kuosa says.\n\nAnd more tools are coming. \u201cNo matter how advanced the tools, the green transition will only succeed if we make it manageable for the people doing the work.\u201d\n\n",

      "text": "As the maritime industry approaches a critical regulatory crossroads, significant technological advancements are strengthening LNG\u2019s position as a viable transition fuel for shipping\u2019s decarbonization journey.\n\nA major breakthrough in methane slip reduction technology was announced yesterday by Kanadevia Corporation, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and Yanmar Power Solutions. Full-scale demonstration trials conducted since May 2025 have achieved a remarkable 98% methane slip reduction rate in real-world conditions, far exceeding their initial 70% target. The trials are being conducted on the LNG-fueled coal carrier REIMEI, operated by MOL, on routes between Japan and Australia.\n\nThis development comes at a crucial time as SEA-LNG, the industry coalition supporting the methane decarbonization pathway, highlighted recent progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from LNG as a marine fuel ahead of next week\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session at the UN International Maritime Organization.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognizes the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway,\u201d said Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG.\n\nLandmark Study Reveals Lower Emissions for LNG Marine Fuel Than Previously Thought\n\nWith approximately 95% of vessels still using oil-based fuels, LNG has emerged as the leading alternative, now representing nearly 20% of the global vessel orderbook.\n\nThe technological breakthrough addresses one of the primary criticisms of LNG as a marine fuel\u2014methane slip, which occurs when a portion of methane in LNG fuel is emitted into the atmosphere unburned. Methane has a higher greenhouse effect than CO2, making its reduction essential from the perspective of GHG reduction.\n\nThe project, funded under the Green Innovation Fund Project \u201cDevelopment of Next-Generation Vessels\u201d led by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), combines methane oxidation catalysts with engine improvements. According to the developers, the technology achieved a 93.8% methane slip reduction rate in land-based trials, which has now been surpassed by the 98% reduction achieved in actual maritime operations at 75% load.\n\nThese developments align with SEA-LNG\u2019s position that the LNG pathway offers immediate and future benefits. Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, noted: \u201cIndependent studies by Sphera and Rystad Energy confirm a steady decline in well-to-tank emissions from LNG over the past decade. With further reductions expected as supply chains evolve, and with LBM and e-methane scaling, the pathway is both credible today and vital for the industry\u2019s long-term transition.\u201d\n\nThe timing of these announcements is particularly relevant as the IMO\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) prepares to meet for its 2nd extraordinary session from October 14-17, at IMO Headquarters in London. The committee will consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 in April 2025.\n\nThe IMO Net-Zero Framework represents a significant shift in maritime regulations, featuring two key elements: a global fuel standard requiring ships to gradually reduce the GHG intensity of their fuels and a pricing mechanism with set prices on GHG emissions. If adopted, these regulations are expected to enter into force in March 2027.\n\nShip emissions under the framework are measured using GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI), which calculates greenhouse gas emissions for each unit of energy used, expressed in grams of CO? equivalent per megajoule. This \u201cwell-to-wake\u201d approach covers emissions from the entire fuel lifecycle\u2014from extraction and production to use onboard.\n\nFor LNG proponents, the advancements in methane slip reduction technology could significantly improve the fuel\u2019s GHG Fuel Intensity profile. This comes as the framework defines \u201czero or near-zero\u201d emission fuels (ZNZs) as those with a GFI of no more than 19.0 gCO?eq/MJ through 2035, after which the threshold tightens to 14.0 gCO?eq/MJ.\n\nThe Yanmar-led project aims to continue onboard trials through the end of FY2026 to evaluate overall system performance and catalyst durability, with the goal of social implementation from FY2027 onward\u2014coinciding with the expected enforcement timeline of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.\n\nFor the maritime industry, these developments suggest that LNG\u2014with its established infrastructure and growing technological improvements\u2014may continue to play a significant role in shipping\u2019s decarbonization pathway, particularly as a transition fuel while other zero-emission technologies mature.\n\nThe question now facing industry and regulators is whether these technological advancements will be recognized within the IMO\u2019s framework and how they might influence the trajectory of maritime decarbonization strategies as the industry navigates toward increasingly stringent emissions regulations.",

      "text": "Governments at the UN\u2019s International Maritime Organization (IMO) are expected to adopt the world\u2019s first global carbon pricing scheme on any international polluter next week, as the shipping industry faces a transformative moment in its environmental regulations.\n\nThe Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC E.2) in London on October 14-17 will consider formal adoption of the \u201cNet-Zero Framework\u201d \u2013 a comprehensive regulatory package aimed at achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by or around 2050.\n\n\u201cThe global industry remains fully committed to working collaboratively with IMO Member States to implement successfully this carefully balanced regulatory package for achieving net zero GHG emissions by or close to 2050,\u201d stated leading international maritime associations in a joint statement released on October 9 from London.\n\nThe statement, backed by organizations representing the majority of the global shipping fleet, emphasized the critical nature of this regulatory framework: \u201cWith the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry\u2019s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field.\u201d\n\nThe maritime transport sector, which moves 90% of global trade, has positioned itself as ready to \u201cplay its important part in delivering a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe IMO Net-Zero Framework, initially approved during the Marine Environment Protection Committee\u2019s 83rd session in April 2025, represents the first global regulatory system to combine mandatory emissions limits with greenhouse gas pricing across an entire industry sector. The framework will be included in a new Chapter 5 of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\n\nUnder the proposed regulations, ships will be required to comply with two key mechanisms: a global fuel standard that will require vessels to reduce their greenhouse gas fuel intensity over time, and a global economic measure that will establish a system of penalties and rewards based on emissions performance.\n\nSpecifically, ships that emit above set thresholds will need to acquire \u201cremedial units\u201d to balance their emissions deficit. This can be accomplished by transferring surplus units from other ships, using previously banked surplus units, or purchasing remedial units through contributions to a newly established IMO Net-Zero Fund.\n\nThis fund will be instrumental in supporting the industry\u2019s transition, with revenues being used to reward low-emission ships, support innovation and research, fund training and technology transfer, and mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable states such as Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.\n\nIndustry leaders have emphasized the importance of global regulations, stating: \u201cOnly global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.\u201d\n\nIf adopted next week as expected, the amendments will likely enter into force in 2027, becoming mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which collectively emit 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping.\n\nThe adoption of this framework would represent a significant victory for climate diplomacy, particularly following the April 2025 agreement that was secured through a vote at the IMO. The shipping industry\u2019s united support could be crucial for the framework\u2019s successful implementation.\n\nKey supporters of the framework are expected to include most BRICS nations, the EU27, Canada, UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Panama, and Chile.\n\nFollowing the expected adoption of the legally-binding regulations next week, technical negotiations will continue during ISWG-GHG-20 (October 20-24) to finalize key details on the design and implementation of the framework. This will be followed by approval of detailed implementation guidelines at MEPC 84 in Spring 2026.\n\nIn his closing remarks at the April meeting, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez noted: \u201cThe approval of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI mandating the IMO net-zero framework represents another significant step in our collective efforts to combat climate change, to modernize shipping and demonstrates that IMO delivers on its commitments.\u201d",

      "text": "The Port of Long Beach has been awarded $20 million by the California Energy Commission to develop Pier Wind, a proposed 400-acre terminal dedicated to assembling and deploying floating offshore wind turbines.\n\nThe funding, which comes from the agency\u2019s Offshore Wind Energy Waterfront Facility Improvement Program through state bond funding, represents a major step forward for California\u2019s renewable energy ambitions despite opposition from the Trump administration. The Port of Long Beach will match the grant with $11 million to complete engineering, environmental, business planning, and community outreach requirements needed to begin construction.\n\nThe proposed $4.7 billion facility aims to help California meet its goal of generating 25 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2045, enough to power 25 million homes statewide.\n\n\u201cOur Pier Wind project will ensure California\u2019s offshore wind energy goals are achieved,\u201d said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. \u201cWe thank the California Energy Commission for funding the Pier Wind project, which will enhance the nation\u2019s energy independence and strengthen the electric grid to support electrification investments across the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWhen completed, Pier Wind would facilitate the assembly of some of the world\u2019s largest offshore wind turbines, which would stand as tall as the Eiffel Tower. These fully assembled turbines would be towed by sea from Long Beach to wind lease areas located 20 to 30 miles off the coast in Central and Northern California.\n\nThe grant funding was made possible by Proposition 4, a climate bond measure approved by California voters in 2024, which allocated $475 million for port infrastructure projects related to offshore wind development. Port officials have indicated they will pursue additional funding from this source as it becomes available.\n\nConstruction on the facility could begin as early as 2027, with the first 200 acres expected to be operational by 2031 and the remaining 200 acres by 2035. A preliminary economic impact report projects that Pier Wind could create more than 6,000 jobs and generate $8 billion in labor income, $14.5 billion in economic output, and $1.3 billion in state and local taxes by 2045.\n\nThe project has received legislative support as well. Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill last year to streamline the design and development process by allowing the Port of Long Beach to use alternative construction delivery methods. Additionally, the California Energy Commission adopted a final strategic plan for offshore wind energy developments that specifically references the need to prioritize seaports like Long Beach for assembly and staging sites.\n\nIn December 2024, the Port of Long Beach entered into a memorandum of understanding with the California State Lands Commission and the Port of Humboldt to collaborate on permitting, community engagement, environmental justice, clean energy strategies, and Native American Tribal consultation to advance a multiport strategy for offshore wind deployment.\n\nThis funding announcement comes amid significant federal policy shifts in offshore wind development as the Trump Administration has all but indefinitely suspended the federal permitting process and targeted projects already under construction with federal stop-work orders\u2014move that could significantly impact states\u2019 investments. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management recently rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, effectively ending the federal designation of more than 3.5 million acres previously targeted for offshore wind development, aligning with a January 20, 2025 executive order targeting the sector.",

      "text": "Container operations at Europe\u2019s largest port, Rotterdam, have come to a standstill as lashers began a 48-hour strike on Wednesday afternoon to demand higher wages, while harbour pilots\u2019 protests in neighbouring Antwerp-Bruges continue to disrupt marine traffic.\n\nDutch union FNV said workers at International Lashing Services and Matrans Marine Services \u2014 the two lashing firms active in Rotterdam \u2014 stopped work at 15.15 hrs local time and will remain off duty until the same time on Friday.\n\nAs lashers are responsible for securing containers aboard vessels, the walkout means no ship can be loaded or unloaded during the strike period, the union said. Major terminals across the port are expected to feel the impact, with some boxships already facing extended laytime.\n\nA spokesperson for the Port of Rotterdam Authority confirmed that the strike would affect vessel turnaround times but said it was too early to quantify the scale of disruption.\n\nThe industrial unrest adds to broader regional turmoil. In Belgium, Flemish harbour pilots have been protesting against federal pension reforms, triggering significant delays at Antwerp-Bruges, Europe\u2019s second-largest port.\n\nAccording to port authorities, only 31 ships were handled on Tuesday, compared with an average of 60 to 80 daily. As of Wednesday morning, over 100 vessels were waiting to enter or leave the port, with several diversions reported.\n\nPilots, represented by the Beroepsvereniging van Loodsen, are limiting work to office hours as part of their action. Negotiations with the government remain stalled, with both sides waiting for the other to resume talks. The pilots have protested for months, arguing that recent pension reforms unfairly target their sector and could reduce future benefits.\n\nThe combined strikes in Rotterdam and Antwerp \u2014 two of Europe\u2019s most critical maritime gateways \u2014 are already prompting warnings of knock-on effects across North Europe\u2019s container and energy supply chains if they drag on.",

      "text": "This October, the member states of the International Maritime Organization can make history by finally adopting an agreement on climate regulation of the shipping industry \u2013 and thus becoming the first global industry to do so.\n\nAs a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.\n\nThe backstory is as follows: In 2023, IMO agreed on a greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy stating that global shipping must become climate neutral around 2050. This was followed earlier this year by the principal agreement on the regulatory framework necessary to make the ambitious GHG-strategy a reality. This Net-Zero Framework must now be finally adopted at the IMO-meeting in London in mid-October.\n\nThe Net-Zero Framework entails concrete mandates for the reduction of emissions from ships as well as a pricing mechanism that puts a cost on un\u00addercom\u00adpli\u00adan\u00adce and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard. These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry\u2019s climate emissions. Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology.\n\nFinal approval at the IMO meeting requires a qualified majority of member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention. It is important that such a majority comes together to shepherd the agreement across the finish line. Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation \u2013 also to address climate change.\n\nThe alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks. Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition. We therefore also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.\n\nTo deliver on the agreed upon GHG strategy, global regulation is a precondition. It is necessary for reducing emissions, for creating homogeneous and predictable framework conditions for the shipping industry and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 sending the strongest possible signal to investors and producers to scale up the production of the alternative fuels that the shipping industry will require to move towards zero emissions.\n\nThe industry supports the IMO Net-Zero Framework, as evidenced by the formal declaration of support of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the clear support of the European Shipowners (ES | ECSA). The co-signers of this article appeal to the IMO member states to come together and vote for global climate measures.\n\nLet\u2019s take the next step and move towards net-zero together. Let\u2019s make history in London.\n\nSignees:\n\n- Japanese Shipowners\u2019 Association: Secretary general, Yasuhiro Shinohara\n\n- Royal Belgian Shipowners\u2019 Association: Managing director, Lo\u00efc Van Staey\n\n- Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners: Managing director, Annet Koster\n\n- Singapore Shipping Association: Executive director, Loh Chun How\n\n- UK Chamber of Shipping: Chief executive Rhett Hatcher\n\n- Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Association: Chief executive, Knut Arild Hareide\n\n- Danish Shipping: Chief executive, Anne H.
