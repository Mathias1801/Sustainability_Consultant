      "text": "- Det er en meget realistisk mulighed nu, at der ikke kommer en global klimaaftale.\n\nS\u00e5dan lyder det fra en f\u00f8lelsesladet Jeppe Juul. Han er transportpolitisk chef i R\u00e5det for Gr\u00f8n Omstilling og var til stede, da en afstemning, der ellers blev betragtet som en formalitet, kollapsede fredag.\n\nDet var i FN's s\u00f8fartsorganisation, IMO's hovedkvarter i London, at den historiske aftale skulle have v\u00e6ret stemt igennem.\n\nAftalen gik ud p\u00e5, at rederier, som overskrider et s\u00e5kaldt 'udledningsloft' - alts\u00e5 en kvote for, hvor meget de m\u00e5 udlede, skulle betale en afgift p\u00e5 100 amerikanske dollar per ton CO2, de udleder.\n\nEfter et omfattende pres fra USA's pr\u00e6sident, Trump, og hans udenrigsminister, Rubio, lykkedes det dog Saudi-Arabien at f\u00e5 vedtaget et forslag om at udskyde afstemningen med et \u00e5r.\n\nLange udsigter til klimaskat efter kollaps\n\nP\u00e5 pressem\u00f8det, efter at beslutningen om at udskyde afstemningen var truffet, fors\u00f8gte IMO\u2019s generalsekret\u00e6r, Arsenio Dominguez, at understrege, at forslaget fortsat lever, og at IMO kan spille en rolle fremadrettet.\n\n- Vi skal ikke d\u00f8mme IMO for det her. Det vil ikke v\u00e6re rimeligt over for organisationen eller dens medlemslande, og faktum er, at arbejdet stadig er i gang, sagde han.\n\nDer har v\u00e6ret direkte trusler mod lande, som overvejede at stemme for den her aftale. Morten B\u00f8dskov, Erhvervsminister (S)\n\nDR's klimaanalytiker, Filip Knaack Kirkegaard, er dog mindre optimistisk.\n\n- Jeg vurderer, at der er lange udsigter til en klimaskat. Det bliver i hvert fald enormt sv\u00e6rt, siger han.\n\nOg hvis den bliver vedtaget n\u00e6ste \u00e5r, vil forsinkelsen kunne m\u00e6rkes.\n\n- Problemet er bare, at hvis den s\u00e5 bliver vedtaget, vil der stadig v\u00e6re tale om en markant forsinkelse. IMO har som m\u00e5l at reducere med 20 til 30 procent inden 2030, og det m\u00e5l var i forvejen meget sv\u00e6rt at n\u00e5, vurderer han.\n\nEuropa m\u00e5 steppe op\n\nHos R\u00e5det for Gr\u00f8n Omstilling mener man, at Europa m\u00e5 forts\u00e6tte arbejdet uden om IMO.\n\n- I mine \u00f8jne betyder det, at vi bliver n\u00f8dt til at steppe op i Europa. Vi er i forvejen i front, men vi bliver n\u00f8dt til at accelerere de reguleringer, vi har, endnu mere og \u00f8ge samarbejdet med for eksempel Kina og Afrika, siger transportpolitisk chef Jeppe Juul.\n\nJeppe Juul fra R\u00e5det for Gr\u00f8n Omstilling kalder situationen f\u00f8lelsesladet, efter at forslaget om en global klimaskat overraskende blev udskudt med et \u00e5r. (Foto: \u00a9 Omid Jafi, DR)\n\nBrian Wessel, som er direkt\u00f8r i S\u00f8fartsstyrelsen, er meget skuffet over, at det ikke lykkedes at f\u00e5 stemt aftalen igennem. Han mener dog ikke, at alt arbejdet er spildt.\n\n- Forslaget er i live, og vi har pr\u00e6cis samme holdning. Industrien har den pr\u00e6cis samme holdning. Vi har stadig alle vores allierede, og vi kommer til at arbejde videre med det her, siger han.\n\nAnne Steffensen, som er administrerende direkt\u00f8r hos Danske Rederier, er ligeledes skuffet. Men hun har heller ikke mistet h\u00e5bet.\n\n- Hvor der er liv, er der h\u00e5b. S\u00e5 derfor bliver vi n\u00f8dt til at arbejde videre med den gr\u00f8nne omstilling. Men det er klart, at det her er et tilbageslag for det arbejde, vi har lavet i s\u00e5 mange \u00e5r.\n\nHun mener, at man har v\u00e6ret oppe imod store kr\u00e6fter.\n\n- Man m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 sige, at det jo ikke industrien, som sp\u00e6nder ben her. Det er jo geopolitik p\u00e5 h\u00f8jt niveau, siger hun.\n\nGeopolitisk modvind\n\n- USA og Saudi-Arabien har vundet.\n\nS\u00e5dan reagerede DR's klimaanalytiker, Filip Knaack Kirkegaard p\u00e5 resultatet af afstemningen om, hvorvidt m\u00f8det skulle udskydes.\n\nOp til m\u00f8det havde USA gjort alt i sin magt for at forhindre aftalen og blandt andet truet de \u00f8vrige medlemslande med straftold, visumrestriktioner og andre sanktioner, hvis de stemte for aftalen.\n\nErhvervsminister Morten B\u00f8dskov (S) kalder forl\u00f8bet meget h\u00e5rdt.\n\n- Der har v\u00e6ret direkte trusler mod lande, som overvejede at stemme for den her aftale. S\u00e5 der er ingen som helst tvivl om, at kampen for at sikre globale gr\u00f8nne aftaler er h\u00e5rd. Det har den altid v\u00e6ret, Men den er blevet h\u00e5rdere, siger han.\n\nErhvervsminister Morten B\u00f8dskov (S) siger, at 'vi m\u00e5 op p\u00e5 hesten igen, og s\u00e5 forts\u00e6tter vi kampen for en gr\u00f8n omstilling.' (Foto: \u00a9 Olivier Matthys, EPA/Ritzau Scanpix)\n\nAt forslaget er standset af en geopolitisk modvind, er Arsenio Dominguez fra IMO helt enig i.\n\n- Den nuv\u00e6rende geopolitiske situation g\u00f8r det vanskeligt for os at g\u00f8re fremskridt indenfor visse omr\u00e5der, lyder det fra generalsekret\u00e6ren.\n\nBrian Wessel fra S\u00f8fartsstyrelsen undrer sig over udviklingen.\n\n- Det kan v\u00e6re lidt sv\u00e6rt at forst\u00e5, n\u00e5r der forinden har v\u00e6ret stor opbakning fra mange lande til at lave en aftale, siger han.\n\nIf\u00f8lge Brian Wessel handler dagens udfald ikke s\u00e5 meget om klima og s\u00f8fart.\n\n- Der er ting, som ikke handler om s\u00f8fart og klima, der kommer ind i det her rum. I april havde vi to tredjedeles flertal, s\u00e5 det har v\u00e6ret en sv\u00e6r uge og et endnu sv\u00e6rere forhandlingsklima, siger han.\n\nOg if\u00f8lge Filip Knaack Kirkegaard, er der en stor chance for, at vi ser dagens begivenheder gentaget om et \u00e5r.\n\n- Selv om forhandlingerne formelt set bare er sat p\u00e5 pause i et \u00e5r, s\u00e5 er det store sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l nu, hvad der skulle v\u00e6re \u00e6ndret om et \u00e5r?, siger han og forts\u00e6tter:",

Og derfor er det if\u00f8lge eksperter afg\u00f8rende, at rederierne betaler en klimaskat, s\u00e5 det i fremtiden ikke er gratis af forurene klimaet.\n\nHvad er Paris-aftalen? I december 2015 underskrev 195 lande Paris-aftalen i den franske hovedstad. I den st\u00e5r der, at den gennemsnitlige globale temperaturstigning skal holdes \"godt under\" to grader. M\u00e5let er, at temperaturen ikke m\u00e5 stige med mere end 1,5 grader. For at n\u00e5 det m\u00e5l er landene i gang med at reducere deres CO2-udslip. M\u00e5let er, at udledningen af drivhusgasser skal tilbage til et niveau, som tr\u00e6er, planter og havet kan optage. Det skal ske mellem 2050 og 2100. Hvert andet \u00e5r skal landene rapportere til FN, hvordan det g\u00e5r med at n\u00e5 klimam\u00e5lene. Landene m\u00f8des hvert femte \u00e5r for at opdatere klimam\u00e5lene i aftalen. M\u00e5lene kan kun opjusteres. Kilder: BBC, DR Nyheder, Politiken, The Guardian\n\nFor at klimaskatten skal blive en realitet, skal et kvalificeret flertal - det vil sige to ud af tre afgivne stemmer - stemme for.\n\nUSA's mange trusler\n\nUSA fors\u00f8ger at forhindre aftalen ved at true andre lande med at ramme dem \u00f8konomisk. Det kan v\u00e6re gennem straftold, s\u00e6rlige havneafgifter eller visarestriktioner. Alts\u00e5 at hindre eller besv\u00e6rligg\u00f8re indrejse til USA, har en talsmand for USA\u2019s regering fortalt nyhedsbureauet Reuters.\n\nSenest har USA\u2019s regering fredag sidste uge truet med at udelukke virksomheder fra lande, der stemmer ja, fra ordrer fra den amerikanske regering s\u00e5som byggeriet af skibe eller gasterminaler.\n\n- Administrationen afviser utvetydigt dette forslag ved IMO og vil ikke tolerere handlinger, der \u00f8ger omkostningerne for vores borgere, energiforsyninger, rederier og deres kunder eller turister, skriver den amerikanske regering i et \u00e5bent brev.\n\nUSA truer ogs\u00e5 med sanktioner mod embedsfolk, der st\u00f8tter \"aktivist-drevet klimapolitik\".\n\nIf\u00f8lge USA vil en klimaskat p\u00e5 rederiernes forurening betyde, at forbrugerne skal betale mere. Men eksperter har ansl\u00e5et, at der er tale om ganske sm\u00e5 prisstigninger. If\u00f8lge forskere fra Sao Paolo Universitet vil priserne p\u00e5 mad stige 0,1-0,2 procent i gennemsnit. Det svarer til 10 \u00f8re for en pose kaffe.\n\nBekymret dansk s\u00f8fartsindustri\n\nNina Porst, der er klimadirekt\u00f8r for Danske Rederier, m\u00e6rker presset. Hendes medlemmer vil gerne have en global klimaskat, fordi de foretr\u00e6kker det frem for en myriade af nationale klimaskatter.\n\n- Vi er bekymrede, siger Nina Porst.\n\nDanmark er i global sammenh\u00e6ng en stor s\u00f8fartsnation. A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk er et af verdens st\u00f8rste containerrederier, og en stribe andre store rederier er med til at give Danmark v\u00e6gt i FN's s\u00f8fartsorganisation.\n\nNina Porst h\u00e6lder til, at det bliver et ja, men t\u00f8r ikke fastsl\u00e5, at det vitterlig vil g\u00e5 den vej.\n\n- De fleste lande holder kortene ret t\u00e6t p\u00e5 kroppen her, s\u00e5 vi kan ikke v\u00e6re sikre p\u00e5, at der bliver en aftale, f\u00f8r den er endeligt vedtaget, siger hun.\n\nKlimaskatten stiger gradvist De 176 lande, der er medlem af FN's s\u00f8fartsorganisation, IMO, skal stemme om at indf\u00f8re en klimaafgift fra 2029. IMO kalder det ikke selv en skat, men i realiteten fungerer det som en skat. Det er dermed den f\u00f8rste globale skat nogensinde. N\u00e5r IMO kan vedtage en global skat, er det, fordi rederier er n\u00f8dt til at betale den, hvis de vil l\u00e6gge til havn i lande, der er medlem af IMO. Skatten koster 100 amerikanske dollar per ton CO2, hvis rederierne overskrider et udledningsloft. Det svarer til cirka 640 kroner. De mest svinende rederier skal betale endnu mere - cirka 2.400 kroner per ton. Alts\u00e5 n\u00e6sten fire gange s\u00e5 meget. I de f\u00f8rste \u00e5r slipper rederierne med kun at skulle betale for en ganske lille del af deres klimabelastning. Gradvist strammer FN kravene, s\u00e5 rederierne fra cirka \u00e5r 2050 skal betale for hele deres forurening.\n\nDanske rederiers tyngde afspejles ogs\u00e5 i klimabelastningen. M\u00e6rsk har et samlet klimaaftryk p\u00e5 mere 83 millioner ton CO2. Det er en st\u00f8rre klimabelastning end hele det danske samfund - inklusive fabrikker, landbruget og alle danskeres forbrug af rejser og importerede varer.\n\nJeppe Juul kalder det en \"reel bekymring\", at aftalen stemmes ned.\n\nMen hans bedste overbevisning er lige nu, at det ikke kommer dertil. Han kalder ikke blot Donald Trump for en \"b\u00f8lle\". Faktisk er han en \"oppustet b\u00f8lle\", mener Jeppe Juul.\n\n- N\u00e5r jeg siger oppustet, er det, fordi USA faktisk ikke spiller en s\u00e6rlig stor rolle i international s\u00f8fart.\n\n- Selv om USA er meget aktiv og meget aggressiv over for medlemslandene, s\u00e5 tror jeg alligevel, at folk kan se fornuften i at f\u00e5 en globalt bindende klimaaftale for s\u00f8farten, siger han.\n\nInternational opbakning\n\nDet s\u00e6rlige ved afstemningen er, at en vedtagelse virkede s\u00e5 sikker som amen i kirken, inden USA begyndte at true.\n\nEt solidt flertal af landene bakkede i april op om at g\u00e5 videre med den model, som nu er p\u00e5 bordet.\n\nSt\u00f8rstedelen af den globale s\u00f8fartsindustri st\u00f8tter ligeledes forslaget, fordi de frygter, at alternativet bliver et indviklet puslespil af nationale klimaskatter. EU har allerede indf\u00f8rt en klimaskat p\u00e5 halvdelen af den fragt, der sejler til og fra EU. Rederierne h\u00e5ber, at en IMO-aftale vil forhindre, at andre lande f\u00f8lger trop.\n\nN\u00e5r der alligevel er nerv\u00f8sitet at spore, er det, fordi USA truer med h\u00e6vn, og s\u00e6rligt fattige lande kan f\u00f8le sig presset til at stemme nej.\n\nFattige lande kan miste penge\n\nLandene har dog ogs\u00e5 en masse at tabe ved at stemme nej.\n\nFor det f\u00f8rste er forslaget det eneste konkrete, globale forslag til at g\u00f8re op med den store klimabelastning, der kommer fra s\u00f8farten. Det er tre procent af den globale udledning af CO2, som stammer herfra, og som kun i meget lille grad i dag er underlagt klimaregulering.\n\nI is\u00e6r verdens fattigste lande medf\u00f8rer den globale opvarmning store katastrofer, og der er akut brug for, at udledningen af CO2 begr\u00e6nses s\u00e5 meget som muligt s\u00e5 hurtigt som muligt.\n\nFor det andet skal dele af pengene g\u00e5 til udvikling af infrastruktur inden for s\u00f8farten i de fattigste ulande. Forskellige analysevirksomheder vurderer, at klimaskatten vil indbringe mellem 65 og 100 milliarder kroner \u00e5rligt.\n\nFN mangler stadig at afg\u00f8re, hvor mange penge der skal g\u00e5 til ulandene, for nogle af pengene skal ogs\u00e5 g\u00e5 til produktion af gr\u00f8nt br\u00e6ndstof. Men hvis landene stemmer nej, er der slet ingen penge, argumenterede IMO\u2019s generalsekret\u00e6r, panamanske Arsenio Dominguez, i en tale ved m\u00f8dets start tirsdag.\n\nDet er endda IMO\u2019s fremtid, der er p\u00e5 spil, indikerer IMO-chefen. Et nej vil \"undergrave tilliden til IMO\", sagde Arsenio Dominguez.\n\nDansk minister h\u00e5ber p\u00e5 'historisk' aftale\n\nForslaget til en global klimaskat er undervejs blevet udvandet og vil kun sikre, at rederierne betaler en fjerdedel af det, EU f\u00f8rst spillede ud med.\n\nIkke desto mindre h\u00e5ber erhvervsminister Morten B\u00f8dskov (S) p\u00e5 en aftale.\n\n- Det er en historisk mulighed for at g\u00f8re noget for klimaet ved, at vi kan vedtage bindende aftaler for skibsfarten, siger erhvervsminister Morten B\u00f8dskov.\n\nDen danske regering har op til m\u00f8det aktivt k\u00e6mpet imod presset fra USA\u2019s pr\u00e6sident, Donald Trump, og redde det forslag, der skal til endelig afstemning i London i denne uge.\n\nMinisteren \u00f8nsker dog ikke at g\u00e5 i detaljer med, hvordan han oplever USA's pres.\n\nHvad er det for nogle tiltag, som USA's pr\u00e6sident Trump er kommet med for at pr\u00f8ve at blokere for den her aftale?",

      "text": "Governments at the International Maritime Organization decided to postpone for one year the adoption of the world\u2019s first global carbon pricing system on shipping at the Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee in London this week.\n\nThe IMO agreed to delay the planned adoption vote on the Net-Zero Framework for one year in a vote Friday due to delay tactics and procedural sabotage by the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates at this week\u2019s negotiations. The motion to delay was put forward by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe IMO\u2019s delay reveals the fragility of climate action when national politics clash with global regulation. For shipping\u2014a sector that moves 90% of world trade and produces 3% of global emissions\u2014the path to net zero just became longer and far more uncertain.\n\nHeading into this week\u2019s meeting, a clear majority of countries had supported the adoption of the Framework, which was agreed in principle in a vote in April. In April, 63 countries voted yes, including the EU27, Brazil, China, India, Canada, UK, Korea and Japan, versus a minority opposition from 16 oil-producing states.\n\nIn the lead up and throughout the meeting, the Trump Administration threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions, especially on developing and most climate-vulnerable states, if they support the Framework.\n\nAccording to our sources, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia also tried to create a delay by proposing to change the IMO\u2019s regular adoption process by consensus to an \u2018explicit\u2019 adoption process which would impose additional hurdles to enforce the Framework, especially for many developing countries.\n\nCountries ultimately voted to delay adoption of the NZF at MEPC E.2 with 57 countries in favor of delay, 49 countries against the delay, and 21 abstentions.\n\nThe agreement would have had a positive effect on the price gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels, essential for shipping\u2019s energy transition.\n\nAs the world\u2019s first, the mechanism would require ships to pay fees for non-compliance with gradually increasing carbon intensity targets, expected to generate up to $15 billion per year in finance from 2030. The original entry into force of the NZF was planned for March 2027. This timeline will now have to be reviewed.\n\nIndustry Reactions\n\nThomas A. Kazakos, ICS Secretary General, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.\u201d\n\nJesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum, called the adjournment \u201ca disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe encourage Member States that agreed on the framework in April to re-confirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO\u2019s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy,\u201d Fahnestock added.\n\nAnne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping, said: \u201cThis is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it\u2019s a big disappointment.\u201d\n\nSteffensen added: \u201cMuch has happened in the world since 2023, when the framework for the strategy was adopted. Unfortunately, that means there have been all sorts of other agendas in the negotiation room besides climate. Geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in \u2013 also at the IMO.\u201d\n\nInternational Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) managing director Patrick Verhoeven described it as a major setback. \u201cShipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation. Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don\u2019t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the sharpest condemnation came from Pacific Island states and environmental groups, who called the delay a betrayal of the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable nations.\n\nDr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: \u201cThe delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying. The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.\u201d\n\nHon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change, Energy, Meteorology, Geohazards, Environment and Disaster Management for the Republic of Vanuatu, said: \u201cWe came to London in reluctant support of the IMO\u2019s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step. We regret that IMO members followed Singapore\u2019s initial proposal to delay the adoption of the framework by 12 months, which Saudi Arabia called to a vote. This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.\u201d\n\nAna\u00efs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, said: \u201cGetting the Net-Zero Framework adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets. Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world\u2019s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.\u201d\n\nU.S. Administration Declares Victory\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz tweeted: \u201cThis is another HUGE win for @POTUS. Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Marc Rubio echoed the same message, calling it \u201canother HUGE win\u201d and thanking the president\u2019s leadership for preventing what he characterized as \u201ca massive UN tax hike on American consumers.\u201d\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThis pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year\u2019s time.\n\nThe IMO is still set to meet again for technical discussions on 20-24 October, to discuss key policy details on design and implementation of the NZF, including green energy incentives and the revenue disbursement.\n\nSome delegates believe that putting the talks on hold will give countries more time to find consensus on this flagship climate law. Others fear that the U.S. will further ramp up pressure on developing countries to oppose adoption at a later stage.\n\nThe agreement includes a requirement for the gradual reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels ships use. Ships that emit more than allowed will have to pay, while the most energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units, as well as receive rewards for using green fuels. Emitting greenhouse gases will become more expensive and reducing them will pay off.\n\nThe NZF, as it stands, is the result of three years of discussions from national delegate countries and is the only global regulation for greenhouse gas reduction measures, which aims at avoiding patchworked national regulation.",

      "text": "The global shipping industry will find out today its green future with one of the most contentious Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meetings drawing to a close this evening at the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the vote on the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) now deemed too close to call.\n\nThe US has led the opposition to the NZF, IMO\u2019s proposed path to ensure shipping decarbonises by around 2050, with the government in Washington issuing threats of sanction to nations that vote in favour of the NZF. Countries backing the IMO\u2019s decarbonisation plan could face port bans, visa restrictions on seafarers, and punitive vessel fees, the US has warned, while earlier this week, the American delegation, in partnership with Saudi Arabia and a number of other petrostates, has been working to create a procedural shift at the IMO that could delay or even block the NZF from entering into force.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about process. It\u2019s about power and political will,\u201d commented Peter Jameson, managing director of Boston Consulting Group, in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social yesterday, president Donald Trump declared the US \u201cwill NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.\u201d The president characterized the measure as a threat to American consumers and called on member states to \u201cvote NO in London.\u201d This isn\u2019t just about process. It\u2019s about power and political will\n\nYesterday, the committee was unable to bring delegations together to proceed with its review of the finalised resolution for the formal adoption of the consolidated MARPOL Annex VI amendments including the NZF. Rising tensions over both content and sequencing of decisions to be taken led the exasperated chairman, Harry Conway of Liberia, to quip whether there was a doctor in the room and to agree to a request of the US to allow time for informal consultations.\n\nThis meant that the plenary session could not proceed in the afternoon with reviewing the report of the drafting group , which had worked late into the evening on Wednesday to complete its work. Unless positive solutions emerge this morning around which delegations can rally, the renowned IMO spirit of cooperation is in grave danger of faltering and scuppering any hope for the entry into force of the NZF on the target date of March 1, 2027.\n\nA formal vote on adoption is expected to take place today and requires a two-thirds majority of MARPOL contracting parties present and voting to be successful. Even if it does succeed, any number of abstentions from the vote would not be good for the IMO\u2019s credibility. The European Union voting as a united bloc now appears unlikely, with sources telling Splash that Greece, Cyprus and Malta are likely to abstain.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t recall witnessing an IMO meeting with so much in flux on such a large scale,\u201d said one source at the IMO with decades of experience of attending meetings at the United Nations body.\n\nA proposal by the United Arab Emirates to include an operative paragraph in the draft MEPC resolution asserting that the IMO\u2019s NZF \u201cis the only global maritime mid-term measure for international shipping so as to avoid a possible patchwork of duplicative State or regional measure\u201d could help limit the damage.\n\nAn extensive work plan to prepare for entry into force could also not be reviewed yesterday. It had been drafted by the secretariat prior to the meeting and was further developed by a working group, which identified 14 major work streams. These include inter alia the development of implementation guidelines on issues such as the greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) and GFI compliance approaches; zero or near-zero greenhouse gas emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources; further development of the IMO Life Cycle Assessment Framework for fuels; the pricing mechanism for the GFI reporting periods starting 2031 and onwards; promotion of technical cooperation and transfer of technology; and food security.\n\nA proposal by Egypt to establish a new IMO sub-committee to deal with the workload related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions received broad support on Thursday morning.\n\nIn the event that the framework does pass today, a technical group is scheduled to meet October 20-24 to finalise guidance on fuel definitions, revenue spending, and compliance rules ahead of the 2027 implementation timeline. Whether the Trump administration would recognise the legislation is a whole other question.",

      "text": "By Jack Wittels (Bloomberg) \u2014 The US made a proposal at talks held by the global shipping regulator to introduce another step in adopting a charge on vessel emissions if countries vote for it this week, as Washington continues to oppose the planned new rules.\n\nNations are at an International Maritime Organization meeting in London to decide on landmark regulations to make vessels start paying for their greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration is strongly against the move, which it has labeled a \u201cglobal carbon tax\u201d on Americans, and has said it would consider wide-ranging measures against those who backed them.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US proposed changing acceptance rules, according to a document provided by the IMO at the meeting.\n\nUsually, under shipping\u2019s main treaty on pollution, new regulations are considered accepted unless a third of countries \u2014 or half the world\u2019s merchant fleet \u2014 declare they object, a process known as \u201ctacit acceptance.\u201d But the US has now proposed that the IMO require \u201cexplicit acceptance\u201d \u2014 effectively needing nations to officially opt in after the vote, according to a document.\n\nThe proposal is another example of the US putting pressure on the planned rules, because it would add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

It outlines practical steps for project teams to integrate technologies such as small modular reactors into maritime assets, covering regulatory, technical, operational and financial requirements.\n\nNuclear power has re-emerged as a potential solution for achieving net-zero ambitions in maritime as the sector accelerates its transition toward sustainable energy. However, no international regulatory framework currently exists for nuclear-powered commercial vessels.\n\nThe guidance discusses the roles of key regulatory bodies including the International Maritime Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency, highlighting the need to harmonize maritime and nuclear standards.

      "text": "By Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Jack Wittels and Eric Martin(Bloomberg) \u2014\n\nEnvironmentalists eager to curb planet-warming pollution from shipping had grown increasingly confident that countries would adopt the first-ever global tax on emissions this year.\n\nBut those predicting success failed to fully account for President Donald Trump harnessing the might of the US against it.\n\nOn Friday, nations at a meeting of the UN\u2019s International Maritime Organization voted to delay by one year a decision on the landmark measure that would force large vessels to curb emissions or potentially incur fees of $380 per ton.\n\nThe outcome was in part the culmination of a months-long campaign by US officials \u2014 including diplomats and cabinet members as well as the president himself \u2014 to fight the fee they decried as an untenable global carbon tax.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump saved America from the outrageous climate scam that was killing our country, and he has long warned others to abandon this destructive agenda before it is too late,\u201d White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said by email. \u201cStopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world that cannot afford to bend the knee to bogus climate demands any longer.\u201d\n\nIndustry Voices Disappointment and Concern as IMO Postpones Global Shipping Carbon Tax Vote\n\nEuropean nations and the UK were among those who had supported the regulations in April when they received preliminary approval, but were on the losing side of Friday\u2019s 57-49 vote in favor of postponement.\n\nThe US wasn\u2019t alone in battling the initiative; nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia had voted against the planned emissions charge in April and on Friday backed the delay.\n\nFor months beforehand, US officials had been pressing other countries to oppose the measure, at times by delivering arguments about the potential costs and national security risks, said a senior US State Department official who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nThe administration\u2019s work picked up in July, when the State Department gathered federal agencies to develop a roadmap to defeat the plan. By August, the State Department had launched a global demarche \u2013 a formal diplomatic outreach to 108 other nations to lay out its opposition.\n\nUS officials also met with European counterparts in Brussels last month to discuss what the senior official described as potential off ramps, and they pressed foreign leaders during meetings on sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\nTrump administration officials also wielded specific threats, warning other nations they could face tariffs, visa restrictions and financial penalties if they backed the so-called net-zero framework, or NZF. Trump himself has widely used tariffs \u2014 and even just the threat of them \u2014 to compel other countries to abandon or ease policies with which he disagrees.\n\n\u201cThe United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy vowed in an Oct. 10 statement. \u201cWe will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.\u201d\n\nA suite of cabinet officials were enlisted to deliver arguments against the initiative, including Wright and Rubio as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, the official said. Conversations unfolded in text messages, phone calls, emails and public meetings, often tailored to anticipate and emphasize the potential concerns of other countries, the official said.\n\nFor instance, Trump administration officials told other nations the fees would deliver widespread economic damage \u2014 hiking costs, stoking inflation and imperiling food security \u2014 although some analysts have described a more modest financial impact.\n\nThey also cast doubt on plans for using the more than $10 billion in revenue the emissions charges were expected to raise annually. While the draft agreement outlined where revenue would end up \u2014 including for ships using low-emission fuels \u2014 key financial details had not been finalized, feeding US officials\u2019 arguments it could be an \u201cenvironmental slush fund.\u201d\n\nUS representatives also assured countries that had some concerns with the measure that they didn\u2019t need to go along with it. Some countries previously felt like it was a foregone conclusion, the senior State Department official said.\n\nThe US opposition may have provided a kind of political cover for other wavering nations \u2014 a scenario that could play out in other international climate talks.\n\nEnvironmentalists called the administration\u2019s approach and the delay misguided. Currently, ships are almost exclusively powered by oil-derived fuels that spew out more than a billion tons of emissions each year.\n\nAlso, the delay would lead to a conflicting patchwork of rules and undermines a potential economic bounty for the US, given its advantage producing lower-emission fuels, they said. Ahead of the vote, some US biofuel producers unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to alter course.\n\nAhead of Friday\u2019s vote, Andrew Forrest, the billionaire founder and chair of of Fortescue Metals Group, decried what he said were \u201cintimidatory tactics\u201d impacting delegates\u2019 ability to vote their conscience.\n\n\u201cAs a global industrialist and philanthropist I stand ready to support any country or individual being blackmailed or threatened,\u201d Forrest said in a message to negotiators at the UN agency. \u201cI am committed to working with others to ensure that justice prevails and bullying tactics do not win out.\u201d\n\nAlthough conversations were at times tense and spirited, there wasn\u2019t intimidation, the State Department official said.\n\nLobbying continued until the final hours. On the eve of the vote, Trump himself swooped in to reinforce the American position on Thursday, amid a last-ditch effort tied to potentially pausing the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cWe will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "The Baltic Exchange has launched two new Aframax tanker benchmarks tracking Canadian crude exports to Asia, marking a direct response to shifting global trade dynamics and escalating geopolitical tensions.\n\nTD28 and TD29, listed on the Intercontinental Exchange on October 13, track voyages from Vancouver to Ningbo, China, and from Vancouver to the Pacific Area Lightering zone off the US West Coast, respectively. The routes have emerged as strategically important following the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion project, which began commercial operations on May 1, 2024.\n\nThe TMX project nearly tripled Canada\u2019s pipeline capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 bpd, transforming the country\u2019s export profile and providing direct access to Asian energy markets.Vancouver\u2019s Westridge Marine Terminal, previously limited to around five Aframax calls per month, can now accommodate up to 34, a shift that has elevated Canada\u2019s role in global crude trade.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic example of the Baltic responding directly to market needs,\u201d said Matt Cox, Head of Benchmark Production at the Baltic Exchange. \u201cThe development of these new routes reflects how trade flows evolve in response to geopolitical realities, from tariff disputes and shifting alliances to sanctions and changing energy security priorities. Our role is to ensure the market has reliable benchmarks that reflect these new dynamics.\u201d\n\nTrans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Fuels Export Boom at Port of Vancouver\n\nThe launch comes as rising US-China trade tensions, Western sanctions on Russian energy, and growing competition for secure energy supplies have made Canada\u2019s Pacific export corridor a strategic alternative for Asian buyers. As the United States and China spar over technology and tariffs, Canadian crude offers a politically safer source of supply, and with TMX now online, the Pacific coast has become a critical export gateway.\n\nBecause fully loaded VLCCs cannot load at Vancouver, Aframax vessels have become the standard for these shipments.Cargoes either sail directly across the Pacific to China or are lightered onto larger tankers off California before continuing their journey. As these flows grow, particularly amid heightened interest from Chinese refiners and diversification strategies among Asian buyers, the need for independent, transparent benchmarks has intensified.\n\nThe development of TD28 and TD29 followed the Baltic\u2019s index creation process, including blind and private trials with market panellists and a public consultation phase.Both routes met the Baltic\u2019s criteria for liquidity, panel participation and commercial relevance before being adopted.\n\n\u201cNew routes are launched after extensive monitoring, consultation and testing to ensure it reflects genuine trade flows and provides real value to the market,\u201d Cox said. \u201cCollaboration with our panel and advisory councils is central to this process and ensures our benchmarks mirror market reality as closely as possible.\u201d\n\nRegular advisory council meetings and ongoing dialogue with industry participants ensure benchmarks evolve alongside new trade patterns, sanctions regimes, and decarbonisation policies such as the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.\n\n\u201cOur engagement with the market is continuous,\u201d Cox added. \u201cTD28 and TD29 are the latest examples of how we listen to members and deliver products that meet the industry\u2019s changing needs. They also show how benchmarks can act as early indicators of deeper geopolitical and commercial trends.\u201d\n\nCox said the early signs for both routes are promising. \u201cFlows of Canadian crude are growing rapidly, and these benchmarks will provide the transparency and consistency needed as the trade matures,\u201d he noted. \u201cUltimately, the success of any index depends on adoption, and we\u2019re confident these routes will quickly become trusted reference points for market participants across the Pacific.\u201d",

      "text": "By Sotiris Nikas (Bloomberg) \u2014 Greece, home to the world\u2019s second-largest merchant fleet, is walking back from supporting a global maritime carbon tax that has drawn backlash from Washington.\n\nThe nation currently plans to abstain from a final vote this week on an International Maritime Organization proposal to make the sector pay for its more than 1 billion tons of annual greenhouse emissions, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information.\n\nAthens had always been skeptical of the net zero framework and its impact on the shipping industry, the person said. In April, however, the country voted yes on a draft plan for the sweeping new rules.\n\nA spokesperson for the Greek government declined to comment.\n\nWhile the European Union is pushing its members to support the maritime levy, the US is strongly opposing it. After threatening to respond with measures such as port levies, visa restrictions and tariffs, Washington proposed introducing another step in adopting the charge, which would add a further hurdle for it to come into force.\n\nGreece\u2019s abstention would mark a departure of the southern European Union member state from the joint position of the bloc, which wants to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, last week called for adoption of the IMO net zero framework, saying it was a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to decarbonize the shipping sector and ensure a level playing field.\n\nGreek\u2019s reservations regarding the levy have been submitted to the European authorities in writing well before the vote, the person familiar with the government\u2019s stance added.\n\nThe net zero framework relies on fuels and technologies that aren\u2019t available at scale, and introduces sharp penalties for not using them, the person said, adding this would inflate costs as companies chase limited supplies.\n\nThe final adoption of the new framework isn\u2019t guaranteed due to Washington\u2019s opposition. In April the draft plan for the new rules had gained wide support.\n\nGreece is the world\u2019s second-largest ship-owning nation, trailing only China, according to data from Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world\u2019s largest ship broker.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

It outlines how shipowners, operators and regulators can approach nuclear propulsion \u2014 from regulatory approval and technical design to insurance and crew training.\n\nAs the industry looks for long-term zero-carbon solutions, LR said nuclear technology \u2014 including small modular reactors (SMRs) \u2014 could play a role in decarbonising deep-sea transport. But it noted that the sector still lacks a unified international framework for regulation, safety, and liability.\n\nThe guidance discusses the roles of the IMO and IAEA, stressing the need to align maritime and nuclear standards. It covers safety classification, environmental assessments, structural integrity, and nuclear safety case development, as well as physical and cyber security measures.\n\nOperational and financial considerations are also addressed, including qualifications for onboard personnel, emergency response plans, and insurance structures. NorthStandard contributed to the section on insurance and liability, noting the current limitations of P&I pooling for nuclear-related risks.\n\nMark Tipping, LR\u2019s global power to X director, said nuclear energy could become a \u201cscalable and zero-carbon\u201d option for shipping, provided there is close collaboration between regulators, operators, insurers and society.\n\nLR added the new framework builds on its earlier Fuel for Thought: Nuclear research and is designed to help early movers navigate the technical, safety and financial hurdles of adopting nuclear propulsion.",

      "text": "On 15 October 2025, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) hosted a conference on 'Young people and transport jobs: making transport careers more attractive' in Brussels. The event brought together around 70 young people and 20 sector representatives from all modes of transport, and the Commission to explore career prospects and expectations for working in the sector, as well as successful practices to attract, support and retain young talent in the ever-evolving transport sector.\n\nParticipants agreed that transport jobs offer great opportunities, but communication about them often misses young people. Industry efforts exist but do not always reach or engage young people effectively. The sector urgently needs young talent, making events like this crucial to connect new generations and the industry, which is eager to hear and respond to their needs.\n\nIn her opening statement, Magda Kopczy\u0144ska, Director-General for Mobility and Transport at the European Commission, emphasised the urgent need to attract younger and more diverse talent to the transport sector. Transport plays a crucial role in building a greener and smarter future, but currently faces a lack of visibility among young people. She encouraged an open dialogue during the conference to explore how to make transport careers more appealing, inclusive, and aligned with modern job expectations across all modes of transport.\n\nKey take aways of an interactive session with young people and human resources representatives include the need to modernise the transport sector's image by emphasising sustainability, diversity, as well as fair and flexible working conditions.\n\nParticipants also called for stronger promotion through positive storytelling, ambassador programmes, job fairs, and school outreach. Practical improvements such as enhanced security, language courses and vocational training, and better coordination among professionals were highlighted. Participants agreed that the ultimate goal is to raise public awareness of the sector's crucial role for society and its evolving, future-ready nature.\n\nThe conference concluded with a dialogue between young people and Eric von Breska, Director of Investment, Innovative & Sustainable Transport at DG MOVE. The discussion focused on key challenges young people face in the sector: visibility and attractiveness of transport jobs, entry points and career development, and skills for the green and digital transition. He explained the European Commission's initiatives aimed at addressing these challenges, highlighting efforts to promote diversity, support skills development, and create clearer career pathways.\n\nA detailed conference report will be published soon.",
