The vessel transferred the captured CO2 to the barge Dejin while docked at Shengdong Terminal \u2014 in what is being hailed as a breakthrough that could transform carbon logistics across the shipping sector.\n\nDeveloped by the Shanghai Marine Diesel Engine Research Institute, part of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the OCCS system captures over 80% of the vessel\u2019s carbon emissions at 99.9% purity. The technology allows the gas to be liquefied and transferred at sea, bypassing the need for specialised port infrastructure and making CO\u2082 offloading more flexible and accessible.\n\nWith a retrofit cost of about $10m \u2014 less than half the price of converting to methanol or ammonia propulsion \u2014 the system presents a commercially viable solution for emissions reduction, according to project stakeholders. More notably, the captured CO2 is not merely stored or sequestered \u2014 it\u2019s being sold into industrial markets, with project estimates suggesting it could generate as much as $8m in annual revenue per vessel.\n\nOne of the barriers to maritime carbon capture has been the difficulty of offloading captured gases at port. The STS transfer approach is seen as a practical workaround, allowing CO2 to be offloaded mid-voyage or near ports using smaller, nimble carriers that can operate closer to end-use markets.",

      "text": "Consolidation \u2013 and by extension greater focus and economies of scale \u2013 continues in the revived Japanese shipbuilding sector with news that Imabari Shipbuilding, the nation\u2019s top yard, is to take control of Japan Marine United (JMU).\n\nThe Higaki family-controlled Imabari announced yesterday it will up its stake in JMU from 30% to 60%, and make it a subsidiary.\n\nJMU is itself a merger of yards, coming out of the consolidation 12 years ago of the shipbuilding operations of JFE Holdings and IHI. JMU and Imabari have been in a business alliance for the past six years.\n\n\u201cImabari Shipbuilding and JMU will leverage each other\u2019s strengths to compete with China and Korea, and will also make efforts to develop the Japanese shipbuilding industry by making quicker and more comprehensive judgments in terms of management,\u201d Imabari said in a release.\n\nJapan, once the undisputed titan of global shipbuilding, is embarking on an ambitious journey to rejuvenate its maritime manufacturing prowess, aiming to double its shipbuilding output by 2030. This strategy, spearheaded by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the newly appointed leadership of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Association (JSIA), is driven by a complex interplay of economic security, decarbonisation imperatives, and a desire to regain significant global market share in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.\n\nFor decades, Japan commanded a dominant position in shipbuilding, accounting for nearly 50% of global output in the 1990s. However, intense price competition, coupled with substantial state subsidies and economies of scale enjoyed by Chinese and South Korean yards, led to a sharp decline. Today, Japan\u2019s global market share has plummeted to roughly 10%, trailing far behind China (70% of newbuild capacity) and South Korea.\n\nYukito Higaki, Imabari\u2019s president, was recently appointed chairman of the JSIA, and he has set an audacious target: regaining at least 20% of the global shipbuilding market share by 2030. \u201cTo become a price leader who has the power to control pricing, we must at least achieve a 20% global market share by 2030,\u201d Higaki stated earlier this month, signalling a clear intent to re-establish Japan as a formidable force.\n\nThe LDP\u2019s proposal, submitted to prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, emphasises the critical role of maritime manufacturing capabilities in national security. The plan is underpinned by Japan\u2019s 2022 Economic Security Promotion Act, allowing direct government support for industries deemed vital to national interest. This includes the rehabilitation of dormant shipbuilding and repair facilities and incentivising public and private investment in next-generation infrastructure.\n\nJapan is actively seeking collaboration with the United States to counter China\u2019s maritime dominance. Discussions are underway for a Japan-US Shipbuilding Revitalization Fund to channel investment into both domestic and US-based yards. Japanese firms are eyeing contracts for car carriers, LNG carriers, and ice-class naval vessels for the US market, positioning themselves as strategic alternatives to Chinese suppliers. This collaboration also extends to naval cooperation and the establishment of a bilateral maritime supply chain decoupled from China.\n\nTo achieve its ambitious goals, Japan\u2019s plan includes a national shipyard model. The government proposes a \u201cstate-owned facility private operation\u201d approach, where the government funds and builds shipyard infrastructure estimated at \u00a550-80bn ($341m to $546m) for new docks and lifting equipment, which is then leased to private enterprises. This new national shipyard will focus on LNG, all linked to energy security. Japan will have a major need to replace old steam turbine units and will need new ships for a US \u2013 Japan LNG trade deal that starts from 2030. JERA, Japan\u2019s biggest power generator, has agreed this month to new supply deals for US LNG. JERA plans to buy up to 5.5m tons per annum of US LNG under 20-year contracts, with deliveries starting around 2030.",

This achievement reflects years of dedicated work and will renew our drive to safeguard human health and the environment in this critical industry,\u201d commented Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization.\n\nLatest statistics from BIMCO show that India is well on track with the new regulation with 110 yards complying with Hong Kong standards. In Bangladesh, just 10 yards, soon likely rising to 14, are ready, and there are 11 compliant yards in Turkey, but none in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan\u2019s federal minister for maritime affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced this week the approval of Rs12bn ($43m) in belated funds to get the country\u2019s Gadani shipbreaking area up to speed with today\u2019s new regulation.\n\nPhilip Roche, global co-head of shipping at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, while hailing today\u2019s entry into force as a \u201cmajor milestone,\u201d warned that the regulatory landscape remains too fragmented.\n\n\u201cThe convention\u2019s impact is arguably limited by its lack of equivalency with the Basel Convention and EU regulations, which continue to restrict access to modern, certified recycling yards in South Asia. Until these frameworks are aligned, shipowners must navigate a complex web of overlapping obligations,\u201d Roche said.\n\nClarksons Research data shows that in 2025 so far, 4.9m dwt has been reported sold for recycling globally, up 12% on 2024\u2019s run rate, the lowest annual since 2007, though still down 57% against the 10-year average. Containership recycling has been especially weak, down 95% on the 10-year average, while gas carrier demolition sales have run at a record pace, up 106% year-on-year, supported by the disposal of steam turbine LNG carriers amid a weak earnings environment.",

      "text": "By Ron Bousso\n\nLONDON, June 22 \u2013 U.S. strikes on several Iranian nuclear sites represent a meaningful escalation of the Middle East conflict that could lead Tehran to disrupt vital exports of oil and gas from the region, sparking a surge in energy prices. But history tells us that any disruption would likely be short-lived.\n\nInvestors and energy markets have been on high alert since Israel launched a wave of surprise airstrikes across Iran on June 13, fearing disruption to oil and gas flows out of the Middle East, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint between Iran and Oman through which around 20% of global oil and gas demand flows.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude prices have risen by 10% to over $77 a barrel since June 13.\n\nWhile Israel and Iran have targeted elements of each other\u2019s energy infrastructure, there has been no significant disruption to maritime activity in the region so far.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to join Israel by bombing three of Iran\u2019s main nuclear sites in the early hours of Sunday could alter Tehran\u2019s calculus. Iran, left with few cards to play, could retaliate by hitting U.S. targets across the region and disrupting oil flows.\n\nWhile such a move would almost certainly lead to a sharp spike in global energy prices, history and current market dynamics suggest any move would likely be less damaging than investors may fear.\n\nCAN THEY DO IT?\n\nThe first question to ask is whether Iran is actually capable of seriously disrupting or blocking the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe answer is probably yes. Iran could attempt to lay mines across the Strait, which is 34 km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point. The country\u2019s army or the paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) could also try to strike or seize vessels in the Gulf, a method they have used on several occasions in recent years.\n\nMoreover, while Hormuz has never been fully blocked, it has been disrupted several times.\n\nDuring the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, the two sides engaged in the so-called \u201cTanker Wars\u201d in the Gulf. Iraq targeted Iranian ships, and Iran attacked commercial ships, including Saudi and Kuwaiti oil tankers and even U.S. navy ships.\n\nFollowing appeals from Kuwait, then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan deployed the navy between 1987 and 1988 to protect convoys of oil tankers in what was known as Operation Earnest Will. It concluded shortly after a U.S. navy ship shot down Air Iran flight 655, killing all of its 290 passengers on board.\n\nTensions in the strait flared up again at the end of 2007 in a series of skirmishes between the Iranian and U.S. navies. This included one incident where Iranian speedboats approached U.S. warships, though no shots were fired.\n\nIn April 2023, Iranian troops seized the Advantage Sweet crude tanker, which was chartered by Chevron, in the Gulf of Oman. The vessel was released more than a year later.\n\nIranian disruption of maritime traffic through the Gulf is therefore certainly not unprecedented, but any attempt would likely be met by a rapid, forceful response from the U.S. navy, limiting the likelihood of a persistent supply shock.\n\nHISTORY LESSON\n\nIndeed, history has shown that severe disruptions to global oil supplies have tended to be short-lived.\n\nIraq\u2019s invasion of neighboring Kuwait in August 1990 caused the price of Brent crude to double to $40 a barrel by mid-October. Prices returned to the pre-invasion level by January 1991 when a U.S.-led coalition started Operation Desert Storm, which led to the liberation of Kuwait the following month.\n\nThe start of the second Gulf war between March and May 2003 was even less impactful. A 46% rally in the lead-up to the war between November 2002 and March 2003 was quickly reversed in the days preceding the start of the U.S.-led military campaign.\n\nSimilarly, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked a sharp rally in oil prices to $130 a barrel, but prices returned to their pre-invasion levels of $95 by mid-August.\n\nThese relatively quick reversals of oil price spikes were largely thanks to the ample spare production capacity available at the time and the fact that the rapid oil price increase curbed demand, says Tamas Varga, an analyst at oil brokerage PVM.\n\nGlobal oil markets were also rocked during the 1973 Arab oil embargo and after the 1979 revolution in Iran, when strikes on the country\u2019s oilfields severely disrupted production. But those did not involve the blocking of Hormuz and were not met with a direct U.S. military response.\n\nSPARE CAPACITY\n\nThe current global oil market certainly has spare capacity. OPEC+, an alliance of producing nations, today holds around 5.7 million barrels per day in excess capacity, of which Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hold 4.2 million bpd.\n\nThe concern today is that the vast majority of the oil from Saudi Arabia and the UAE is shipped via the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe two Gulf powers could bypass the strait by oil pipelines, however. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, producing around 9 million bpd, has a crude pipeline that runs from the Abqaiq oilfield on the Gulf coast in the east to the Red Sea port city of Yanbu in the west. The pipeline has capacity of 5 million bpd and was able to temporarily expand its capacity by another 2 million bpd in 2019.\n\nThe UAE, which produced 3.3 million bpd of crude oil in April, has a 1.5 million bpd pipeline linking its onshore oilfields to the Fujairah oil terminal that is east of the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nBut this western route could be exposed to attacks from the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have severely disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal in recent years. Additionally, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar currently have no clear alternatives to the strait.\n\nIt is possible that Iran will choose not to take the dramatic step of blocking the strait in part because doing so would disrupt its own oil exports. Tehran may also consider any further escalation fruitless in light of U.S. involvement and will instead try to downplay the importance of the U.S. strikes and come back to nuclear negotiations.\n\nIn the meantime, spooked energy markets, fearing further escalation, are apt to respond to the U.S. strikes with a sharp jump in crude prices. But even in a doomsday scenario where the Strait of Hormuz is blocked, history suggests markets should not expect any supply shock to be persistent.\n\n(Ron Bousso;Editing by Helen Popper and David Evans)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.",

      "text": "Utility-scale wind projects are springing up along the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf of Mexico, and\u2014within the decade\u2014off the Pacific Coast. Federal lease auctions have committed roughly 4 million offshore acres to wind development, and the Biden administration set a goal of 30 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by 2030. That is enough clean electricity to serve millions of homes, slash carbon emissions, and create tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nBut there is a hard truth behind these optimistic headlines: offshore wind work is physically demanding, weather-dependent, and often dangerous. Unless operators bring a safety-first mindset to every turbine foundation, cable lay, and crew transfer, the push for green energy will come at a human cost.\n\nEarly Data on Offshore Wind Shows High Injury Rates\n\nA 2023 peer-reviewed study published in ScienceDirect found that U.S. offshore wind construction crews recorded significantly higher injury rates than North Sea oil and gas workers performing similar tasks. The authors performed a systematic review of more than 100 published papers and incident datasets from both the United States and Europe, identifying key recurring hazards in offshore wind.\n\nThe study attributed most recordable incidents to:\n\nHeavy lift operations and crane work around foundations and nacelles.\n\nand around foundations and nacelles. Working at heights inside cramped turbine towers and nacelle housings.\n\ninside cramped turbine towers and nacelle housings. Personnel transfers between vessels and fixed structures in rough seas.\n\nbetween vessels and fixed structures in rough seas. Electrical faults and confined space hazards during commissioning and maintenance.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)\u2014best known for policing offshore oil and gas operations\u2014performed its first offshore wind turbine inspection in June 2024, a sign that U.S. regulators are beginning to watch the sector closely.\n\nWhen it comes to offshore wind safety, the data pool is still small, but the signal is clear. As the offshore wind workforce grows, every lesson learned from early incidents must be translated into tougher standards, smarter training, and safer worksites.\n\nRecent Incidents, Injuries & Fatalities\n\nEven in an industry built on risk management, serious offshore wind accidents have surfaced worldwide. A snapshot of just the last few years shows how quickly operations can turn catastrophic.\n\nCTV & Turbine Collision \u2013 German North Sea (2023)\n\nA high-speed crew transfer vessel struck an operating turbine while approaching a ladder, tearing open the bow and injuring two technicians. Investigators with Germany\u2019s Federal Bureau of Maritime Casualty Investigation (BSU) cited excessive speed, limited visibility from the wheelhouse, and poor lookout practices as root causes.\n\nLightning Damage \u2013 Vineyard Wind 1, Massachusetts (March 2025)\n\nA newly installed 13 MW turbine was shut down after a direct lightning strike fractured blade sections and scorched electrical components. While no one was hurt, the incident exposed the need for comprehensive lightning protection systems as Atlantic projects push into storm-prone waters.\n\nBlade-Debris Shutdown \u2013 Vineyard Wind 1, Massachusetts (July 2024)\n\nOperators idled one of America\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farms when a fiberglass fragment from a GE blade washed ashore on nearby beaches. The project remained offline during inspections.\n\nSupport Vessel Crash \u2013 North Sea (2024)\n\nA 27-meter offshore support vessel slammed into the monopile of an operating turbine during personnel transfer, injuring two crew members and denting the tower. Early reports pointed to a sudden loss of maneuverability in quartering seas and inadequate contingency planning for propulsion failure.\n\nFatal Sinking After Impact \u2013 East Asia (2022)\n\nA construction barge preparing to install turbine components collided with an existing structure, holed the hull, and sank within minutes. Four crew members were lost. Regulators later concluded the bridge team relied on a single radar display and failed to post an effective visual lookout in low visibility.\n\nWhere Things Go Wrong: Key Offshore Wind Hazards\n\nThe crews that build and maintain offshore wind farms face unique hazards applicable to both the offshore industry and the wind energy industry. Constructing a wind turbine is difficult enough, but installing it miles offshore in hundreds of feet of water is an entirely different matter. Heavy weather and rough seas\u2014not to mention a lack of access to prompt medical attention when the need arises\u2014increase the risks to worker well-being.\n\nThe most significant offshore wind hazards are:\n\nHeights & Ladders\n\nTechnicians must climb to heights of 300 feet or more to access nacelles. A fall from such a height will most likely be fatal; a worker who does survive may experience catastrophic spinal cord injuries, broken bones, and traumatic brain injuries.\n\nHeavy Lifts & Crane Operations\n\nNacelle hubs, blades, and monopile sections of an offshore wind turbine may weigh hundreds of tons. Moving and positioning these places workers at risk of suffering harm from uncontrolled swings, crane failures, or dropped loads.\n\nElectrical & Arc Flash\n\nHigh-voltage export cables and converters pose burn and electrocution risks, especially during offshore wind commissioning. Laying cables can be particularly risky, as these can become energized by cables running parallel or nearby.\n\nConfined Spaces\n\nOffshore wind turbine technicians frequently work inside nacelles and tower interiors, which contain limited egress routes. These confined spaces present risks ranging from fires to toxic atmospheres that can cause serious injury or death.\n\nFatigue & Weather Windows\n\nLong transits and tight construction schedules may tempt companies to keep crews working in marginal conditions to meet deadlines. Failures to evacuate in hurricanes and tropical storms or unsafe shifts and hitches can put workers at undue risk.\n\nSpotlight on Gangway Transfers & Vessel Collisions\n\nCrew transfer vessels (CTVs) and service operation vessels (SOVs) may rely on motion-compensated gangways to \u201cwalk\u201d technicians onto turbine landings. When swell, current, or wind conditions exceed design limits, however, those bridges can slam, drop, or shear sideways.\n\nRecharge magazine recently warned of a spate of serious gangway injuries\u2014rib fractures, shoulder dislocations, spinal trauma\u2014despite modern active-heave compensation. Manufacturers continue to refine sensors and auto-disconnect systems, but the ultimate responsibility lies with vessel masters and project managers who must call off transfers when conditions deteriorate.\n\nCollisions with offshore wind installations are another hazard. Whether it\u2019s a crew transfer vessel edging in to \u201cwalk-to-work\u201d technicians or a cargo ship straying off course, any ship that strikes a turbine risks major damage and serious injuries. Close-quarters maneuvers leave inches to spare; a sudden gust, engine fault, or navigation error can drive a bow into the monopile, dent towers, or shower workers with debris. Outside traffic\u2014fishing boats, bulk carriers, tankers\u2014may violate exclusion zones and collide in poor visibility.\n\nRegulatory Oversight for Offshore Wind\n\nBecause offshore wind farms are located on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, most construction vessels carrying turbine components from U.S. ports must be Jones Act\u2013compliant: built, owned, and crewed by Americans. Injured seafarers therefore have Jones Act and general maritime law rights to maintenance, cure, and damages from negligence or unseaworthiness.\n\nTurbine towers and substations are considered \u201cfacilities\u201d under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), giving the BSEE enforcement authority offshore. However, the BSEE has been known to underreport offshore worker injuries and fatalities.\n\nIn terms of safety, OSHA standards apply to U.S.-flagged vessels and in U.S. ports. Shore-based technicians serving coastal staging yards normally fall under state workers\u2019 comp or the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; however, if they work on a vessel, maritime statutes may apply. Understanding which regulations apply and which agencies are responsible for enforcing them is a key aspect of identifying crew members\u2019 rights while working on offshore wind installations.\n\nWhat Offshore Wind Workers Are Entitled To\n\nWhether a person is classified as a Jones Act seaman, a longshoreman, or any other type of worker, the law demands that employers provide a safe workplace. When companies ignore weather limits, skip maintenance, or staff vessels with fatigued crews, injured workers can pursue compensation to help them rebuild.\n\nThis may include:\n\nLost wages and future earning capacity\n\nMedical and rehabilitation costs for as long as treatment is needed\n\nDamages for pain, suffering, and diminished quality of life\n\nWrongful death compensation for families when tragedies occur\n\nLegal claims tied to offshore wind projects are unusually complex, in large part because they unfold under overlapping maritime statutes and an industry framework that is still taking shape.\n\nAmerica\u2019s offshore wind buildout promises thousands of jobs, billions in port investment, and cleaner energy. But none of that justifies cutting corners on crew safety. As turbines climb past 12 megawatts (MW), nacelle drops exceed 400 feet, and gangways stretch over record swells, only data-driven risk management, comprehensive training, and strict regulatory compliance can keep pace.\n\n###\n\nAs the nation\u2019s leading maritime law firm, Arnold & Itkin has stood with crews and families after the worst offshore disasters of the last two decades.

      "text": "Since the 1st of January 2025, shipowners have faced new, strict restrictions on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity levels when calling in EU ports. Unlike previous regulations, FuelEU Maritime is enforced by hefty penalties for non-compliance, driving action in ways previous initiatives, like the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), struggled to achieve.\n\nThese penalties are designed to make an impact, and they are. At \u20ac2,400 per tonne of VLSFO energy equivalent, fines are steep enough to turn compliance into a business-critical decision. Analysis from OceanScore estimates that passenger vessels could face penalties averaging \u20ac520,000 per year, while the global tanker fleet may collectively incur costs of \u20ac2 billion by 2030, according to Broker BRS Group. Meaning that the seemingly small initial GHG reduction of 2% has real influence.\n\nWith it still being early days for FuelEU Maritime compliance, shipowners and operators are still evaluating the best strategies on the table but it\u2019s best not to wait too long. To provide some color, NAPA has conducted simulations comparing the costs of both a 182kDWT bulker operating on a cross Atlantic route and for a roro equipped with Flettner rotors operating inside the EU.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that trying to forecast costs until 2050 using static values in a very dynamic environment (e.g. EUA pricing, bunker pricing, bunkering strategy, FuelEU compliance strategies) can be difficult. Still, this data suggests that while FuelEU maritime is not yet a significant contributor for the total fuel and emission related operational expenses, this will quickly change for both vessels as FuelEU Maritime requirements tighten.\n\nThe graph on the left shows that the non-compliant bulker will have to start paying FuelEU Maritime penalties from this year itself. The graph on the right depicting the roro with Flettner rotors, however, highlights that investments in wind assisted propulsion systems will help offset FuelEU Maritime costs, helping vessels stay compliant till 2030 due to the emission savings achieved.\n\nFurther simulations based on NAPA\u2019s performance model reveal the scale of the potential costs involved \u2013 although exact prices will be set by the market. For example:\n\nA typical capesize bulk carrier operating between Brazil and Rotterdam consumes approximately 16,700 tons of fuel annually, considering both VLSFO 380 CST and LSMGO. This would put its GHG intensity to 91.4gCO2/MJ and take its compliance balance to 703.70 tonCO2 eq in deficit. This represents nearly \u20ac450,750 in penalties for 2025, adding 5.1% to bunkering costs. Alternatively, based on MMMCZCS\u2019 estimates that external pooling will cost around \u20ac420 per ton, the cost increase would instead be 0.9%.\n\nAn LNG-powered feeder-size container vessel operating between Rotterdam and the Baltic Sea would consume approximately 2250 tons of LNG. Given the well-to-wake emission factors set by FuelEU, the vessel would generate 30 tons of compliance surplus. It would be just about compliant and wouldn\u2019t have much surplus to trade through pooling.\n\nAll of this sets the scene nicely for new business opportunities as FuelEU Maritime doesn\u2019t just penalize; it creates rewards and opportunities. Vessels that meet or exceed compliance thresholds can not only increase asset value and improve access to finance but can also offer surplus compliance credits for pooling to other vessels. Pooling, borrowing, and trading compliance surpluses could lead to the creation of new markets, rewarding companies who are proactively investing in green technologies. For compliant vessels, this isn\u2019t just about avoiding fines \u2013 it\u2019s about gaining a competitive edge in the market.\n\nHow can ship owners decide on the best path for them?\n\nEveryone will approach FuelEU differently, but whichever path is chosen, early knowledge and proactive action will pay dividends. Data will be essential from the start to enable shipowners to simulate scenarios and assess the cost-effectiveness of different compliance strategies. Tools like the NAPA FuelEU Maritime module have been designed to provide precise calculations on a voyage-specific and fleet-wide basis, helping shipowners weigh up these options with confidence.\n\nReal-time monitoring of fuel consumption and emissions allows shipowners to track their compliance. For vessels nearing their limits, data provides timely insights, enabling decisions like adjusting routes, increasing drop-in biofuel usage, or reallocating compliant ships. Without such monitoring, shipowners risk incurring preventable penalties or missing opportunities for operational efficiency.\n\nFor vessels that are over compliant, data becomes a means to unlock financial opportunities. NAPA\u2019s FuelEU Maritime module calculates surplus availability and offers projections on pooling profitability, ensuring shipowners can maximize returns on their green investments.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFuelEU isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. It builds on the spirit of regulations like the EU ETS and the IMO\u2019s CII and affirms the industry\u2019s general direction of travel towards decarbonization. We must also consider the IMO Net Zero Framework, which is expected to be ratified in October 2025. Time will tell whether this framework will make EU-level GHG regulations for shipping obsolete, however the trend of more stringent environmental regulations remains. Shipowners who embrace this shift will not only avoid penalties but also position themselves as leaders in a more sustainable industry. By leveraging data, adopting green fuels, and exploring compliance strategies like pooling, the maritime sector can turn regulation into a catalyst for innovation and growth.\n\nSource: By Ossi Mett\u00e4l\u00e4, Product Manager, NAPA Shipping Solutions",
