      "text": "Regeringen vil s\u00e6nke elafgiften i 2026 og 2027. Faktisk vil de n\u00e6rmest helt fjerne den.\n\nI dag betaler forbrugerne 72,7 \u00f8re per kilowatt-time, men fra den 1. januar 2026 ryger afgiften helt ned p\u00e5 blot 0,8 \u00f8re per kilowatt-time. Det svarer til EU's minimumsafgift.\n\nOnsdag aften bekr\u00e6ftede regeringens tre partiledere afgiftsneds\u00e6ttelsen i interviews med TV 2 og Ekstra Bladet.\n\nDe begrunder neds\u00e6ttelsen med, at der skal v\u00e6re luft i husholdningernes budgetter, selv om f\u00f8devarepriserne er steget kraftigt de senere \u00e5r.\n\n- Vi vil gerne give danskerne noget mere albuerum i deres \u00f8konomi, siger statsminister Mette Frederiksen til Ekstra Bladet.\n\nForbrugerne sparer tusindvis af kroner\n\nHvor meget du som forbruger kan spare, afh\u00e6nger af dit el-forbrug, men regeringens beregninger viser, at en typisk l\u00f8nmodtagerfamilie i et parcelhus vil spare omkring 4000 kroner om \u00e5ret, mens et typisk pensionistpar skal betale omkring 2700 kroner mindre i el-afgift.\n\nHvis det stod til mig, s\u00e5 ville jeg da gerne fjerne elafgiften permanent Troels Lund Poulsen, formand for Venstre\n\n- Det er noget, man kommer til at kunne m\u00e6rke i alle danske husstande, sagde statsminister Mette Frederiksen i aftes i et TV 2-interview med de tre partiledere.\n\nRegeringens egne beregninger viser, at afgiftslettelsen kommer til at koste statskassen 7,1 milliard kroner i 2026 og 7 milliarder kroner \u00e5ret efter.\n\nPengene skal tages fra det \u00f8konomiske r\u00e5derum.\n\nRos til regeringens tiltag\n\nDansk Industri og Green Power Denmark, der er brancheorganisation for den danske energisektor, roser begge regeringens tiltag.\n\nDansk Industris vicedirekt\u00f8r,Troels Ranis, udtaler i en pressemeddelelse:\n\n- Det skal selvf\u00f8lgelig \u00f8konomisk kunne betale sig at oml\u00e6gge energiforbruget til gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m. Regeringens lempelse af el-afgiften vil spare penge for de danske husholdninger, og det vil hj\u00e6lpe b\u00e5de dem og de ikke-momsregistrerede virksomheder til at oml\u00e6gge deres energiforbrug i retning af el.\n\nKristian Jensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r Green Power Denmark, kalder forslaget \"en gave til den gr\u00f8nne omstilling\". (Foto: \u00a9 Bo Amstrup, Bo Amstrup / Ritzau Scanpix)\n\n- Begge dele vil hj\u00e6lpe til at sikre udbygningen med gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m.\n\nGreen Power Denmark kalder forslaget \"en gave til den gr\u00f8nne omstilling\".\n\n- I dag kommer hovedparten af str\u00f8mmen fra gr\u00f8nne kilder som vindm\u00f8ller og solceller, og det er et k\u00e6mpe paradoks, at det, vi skal bruge mere af, er belagt med en t\u00e5rnh\u00f8j afgift.\n\n- Regeringen kan ikke finde p\u00e5 en mere fornuftig afgiftslettelse, end den har gjort her, siger administrerende direkt\u00f8r Kristian Jensen.\n\nMere forbrugertiltag end gr\u00f8n omstilling\n\nHos den gr\u00f8nne t\u00e6nketank Concito er de ogs\u00e5 overordnet positive overfor afgiftsneds\u00e6ttelsen, selvom chef\u00f8konom Torsten Hasforth prim\u00e6rt ser det som et forbrugertiltag.\n\n- Fra et klimasynspunkt s\u00e5 er det her en administrativ lettelse. Det er ikke en k\u00e6mpe dag for klimaet, men det g\u00f8r det lettere for noget af det forbrug, vi har, siger chef\u00f8konomen til DR.\n\nTorsten Hasforth tror, at det g\u00f8r det lettere for forbrugerne, at afgiften generelt neds\u00e6ttes, for tidligere har der v\u00e6ret en r\u00e6kke s\u00e6rorninger med lavere elafgifter for eksempelvis varmepumper og elbiler.\n\n- De var lidt besv\u00e6rlige, og det regeringen i virkeligheden g\u00f8r nu, er at de fjerner behovet for de her s\u00e6rordninger. Og det at forbrugerne fra 2026 ikke selv skal finde ud af, hvordan man f\u00e5r den lave elafgift til sin elbil og varmepumpe, det er jo godt for klimaet.\n\nConcito er en uafh\u00e6ngig, non-profit forening, der arbejder for at reducere drivhusgasser og fremme den gr\u00f8nne omstilling.",

      "text": "French liner giant CMA CGM is making a strategic minority investment in US-based Vanguard Renewables through its energy fund PULSE, securing long-term access to volumes of renewable natural gas (RNG). Vanguard, which runs anaerobic digesters powered by farm and organic waste, will dedicate up to four projects to produce biomethane, or bio-LNG for the Marseille-headquartered carrier.\n\nThe move comes amid the International Maritime Organization\u2019s recent net-zero framework, which requires shipping companies to lower greenhouse gas emissions or face penalties.\n\nVanguard Renewables works with food and beverage manufacturers and retailers to divert organic waste from landfills and convert it into RNG. The company is a portfolio company of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), part of BlackRock.\n\nMichael O\u2019Laughlin, CEO, said: \u201cWe see this pioneering collaboration as a key step in supporting the maritime sector as the global industry takes a bold step toward improving emissions.\u201d\n\nCMA CGM\u2019s interest in biomethane goes back several years. The company co-invested with ENGIE in the Salamander biomethane project in Le Havre, targeting industrial-scale production of up to 200,000 tonnes of renewable gas annually by 2028.\n\nIt also signed a deal with SUEZ to secure up to 100,000 tonnes of biomethane per year by 2030, backed by an initial \u20ac100m investment to develop production sites in Europe.\n\nOn the technological front, CMA CGM has taken a stake in Hycamite, a Finnish clean-tech company developing methane-splitting technology that turns methane into low-carbon hydrogen and solid carbon products.\n\nIn parallel, CMA CGM formed a 50/50 joint venture with TotalEnergies to launch an LNG bunkering service in Rotterdam. The plan includes commissioning a 20,000 cu m LNG bunker vessel by 2028 and securing up to 360,000 tonnes of LNG annually until 2040.\n\nThe moves sit within CMA CGM\u2019s broader decarbonisation strategy, which has seen over 100 low-carbon newbuilds ordered, including dual-fuel LNG and bioLNG-ready ships joining the fleet in the coming years.",

      "text": "Nigerian tanker buyers have stepped up their activity this summer, snapping up three ships from June onwards \u2014 more than doubling their deal count for the year, according to data from VesselsValue. To date, seven secondhand tanker acquisitions have been tracked to Nigeria in 2025.\n\nThe latest round of deals includes Triber Energy, which has acquired the 2013-built clean tanker, Fula Queen (5,000 dwt, ex-Jeanita), the youngest conventional tanker purchased by a Nigerian owner this year. No price has been disclosed. This marks Triber\u2019s third clean tanker acquisition.\n\nSea and Transport, led by Mohammed Aminu Umar, has been linked to the purchase of a Korea-built MR1 (41,000 dwt, SLS, 2009-built). The ship was reportedly sold by Stamford Shipping for $17.2m. If confirmed, this would be Sea and Transport\u2019s first deal of 2025, reinforcing its MR-focused profile.\n\nShip and Shore Services, meanwhile, has also been active, sealing its second deal of the year, buying the 22-year-old, 37,300 dwt, STX-built Favola for $7.4m. The company had already added a 17-year-old, 13,000 dwt clean tanker in April.\n\nWhile activity is rising, most Nigerian purchases remain firmly in the vintage category \u2014 with the Fula Queen standing out as the rare younger unit to enter the country\u2019s fleet.\n\nNigeria\u2019s refining rebirth is finally underway\u2014led by the recently launched Dangote Refinery, the world\u2019s largest single-train refinery, and bolstered by resurgent state facilities, modular entrants, and smart policy reforms. If execution holds, the country is on the cusp of reclaiming refining independence and shoring up its foreign exchange reserves.",

If the situation in the Red Sea was a defining factor which contributed to the strong performance of the container shipping market in 2024, then the ongoing changes in tariff policies and trade disputes have undoubtedly played a decisive role in shaping market trends in the first half of 2025.\u201d\n\nOOIL posted stronger interim earnings yesterday.

      "text": "Philippos Ioulianou, managing director of EmissionLink, writes for Splash today.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to FuelEU enforcement in January and the International Maritime Organization\u2019s 2050 net-zero target looms, dual-fuel engines have become the frontline tool for navigating tightening emissions rules.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. Owning a dual-fuel engine doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to benefit from an emission-free future. Managing one well requires diligence and monitoring systems which can spell double trouble if not handled properly.\n\nFor example, the flexibility of LNG/VLSFO or methanol/MGO setups can help operators juggle regional rules, fuel pricing, and emissions constraints. However that same flexibility introduces a degree of complexity. Fuels like VLSFO degrade quickly, and unless crews are monitoring quality closely, it can cause performance issues or even non-compliance. Switching between fuel types also demands flawless execution, one miss-step risks engine damage or unexpected emissions spikes. In addition, the performance of the engine has to remain consistent across different combustion requirements, no small achievement when conditions are subject to change mid-voyage.\n\nIn addition, FuelEU regulations raise the bar on compliance from annual reporting to voyage-by-voyage scrutiny. Real-time data is no longer a nice-to-have, it\u2019s a requirement. Operators must know exactly which fuel was used, where, and how it performed. They need to be able to demonstrate that emissions stayed within limits and prove that they can spot and fix problems before they escalate. Decarbonisation has become a daily discipline, and anyone still relying on spreadsheets or best guesses is already falling behind.\n\nThis level of scrutiny requires data discipline. It\u2019s why tools like EmissionLink are being used to help operators consolidate live emissions data, align it with fuel usage, and create a trusted, auditable trail for both regulatory bodies and commercial partners. Without such systems, shipowners risk relying on incomplete logs, manual reporting, and unverifiable claims, none of which will stand up in a compliance audit.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about staying on the right side of regulators. Dual-fuel engines, when managed properly, can deliver real commercial benefits. Strategically using cleaner fuels on EU legs, for example, can generate FuelEU compliance credits that can be banked, traded, or used to offset emissions elsewhere in the fleet. Also, now charterers are paying attention. They want reliable, real-time emissions data as well as transparency and accountability around fuel switching.\n\nThis is already being written into charterparty clauses. A recent update from London law firm, HFW, reported an increase in claims relating to the management of dual-fuelled vessels, where traditional fuels have not been consumed within their shelf-life, meaning they are no longer fit for use and must be de-bunkered. This practice can present a significant risk for charterers, as the diminution in the value of the de-bunkered fuel is not ordinarily insurable.\n\nAs a result, roles and responsibilities around fuel management and reporting are becoming contractual obligations. Owners who can\u2019t support their claims with data could find themselves locked out of premium charters. Those who do may well be first in line for green corridors and ESG-aligned cargo.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, at present a lot of ships with dual-fuel engines aren\u2019t fully compliant. Fuel protocols are inconsistent. Data is patchy. Crews aren\u2019t always fully prepared. Whilst this continues there\u2019s also no clear strategy for turning regulatory pressure into commercial advantage.\n\nThe next 12 months will reveal who\u2019s serious about decarbonisation and who\u2019s simply hoping that newer engines and cleaner fuel will be enough. They won\u2019t be. Not without systems to track, people to manage, and strategies to act.\n\nIn this new regulatory era, burning cleaner fuel badly is still a failure and risks turning a decarbonisation solution into just another liability.",

      "text": "LR\u2019s latest FOBAS Fuel Insight report highlights broadly steady fuel quality with particular issues around high sediments and chemical contamination, and an increased use of biofuel blends with developments in energy-content measurement.\n\nGlobal bunker fuel quality remained resilient in the first half of 2025 despite growing fuel diversity and tightening environmental regulation, according to Lloyd\u2019s Register\u2019s latest FOBAS Fuel Insight report.\n\nThe findings highlight how improved testing, data sharing and operational practices are supporting shipowners as they adapt to cleaner blends and stricter sulphur limits.\n\nAnalysis of fuels tested by LR\u2019s Fuel Oil Bunkering Analysis and Advisory Service (FOBAS) shows that the vast majority met specification and were fit for purpose \u2013 3.5% of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) fuel samples were off-spec, but only a small fraction of these were unusable. For example, 0.6% of VLSFO samples exceeded the 0.53% 95% confidence range of the 0.50%m.m MARPOL Annex VI limit. Sediment stability also showed varied performance at major ports, with certain ports facing continued problems while others providing much more stable fuel. Distillate fuels continued to demonstrate predictable behaviour, remaining the premium choice for operations requiring tighter quality control.\n\nSustainability and fuel diversity are key trends in the H1 2025 findings. Uptake of FAME-based biofuel blends, notably B30 RF, is increasing across ports including Singapore, Algeciras and Antwerp. This is being driven by regulatory clarity from MEPC 83 and ISO 8217:2024, which confirmed that blends up to 30% are treated as conventional fuels, simplifying NOx compliance. FOBAS testing to date has found no systemic operational issues with these blends, with most quality considerations linked to the conventional fuel components.\n\nThe report also notes a growing shift to direct calorific value measurement, using ASTM D240 Bomb Calorimetry, to more accurately account for the lower energy content of biofuel blends. Early adopters report more precise consumption forecasting, improved voyage planning and reduced cost variability.\n\nRegulatory change has also continued to shape fuel decisions. From 1 May 2025, the Mediterranean\u2019s designation as a Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA) brought a 0.10% sulphur limit into force, prompting operators to fine-tune fuel management strategies alongside preparations for EU and FuelEU Maritime requirements.\n\nUsman Muhammad, FOBAS Product Manager, said: \u201cShipowners today face a more complex fuel landscape than ever before. Our latest findings show that quality remains high and compliance strong, but also that success increasingly depends on proactive testing, data-driven decision-making and close cooperation between suppliers and operators. This approach will be essential as the industry accelerates its transition to low- and zero-carbon fuels.\u201d\n\nRead the latest FOBAS Fuel Quality Report here.",

      "text": "Cat Pushes Forward on Hybrid Electric Solutions, Alternative Fuels\n\nAs the maritime industry continues its transformation driven by decarbonization mandates, OEMs like Caterpillar are central to paving the path. Will Watson, Marine Product Manager, Caterpillar, discusses latest efforts by the company to unlock the potential with hybrid electric and alternative fuel solutions.\n\nKey Takeaways to Caterpillar Marine\u2019s Hybrid Propulsion\n\n\u2022Hybrid Propulsion Systems: Diesel + battery solutions optimized for fuel savings and emission control.\n\n\u2022Dual-Fuel Engines (Methanol): 3500-series engine platform capable of burning methanol or conventional fuels.\n\n\u2022Digital Monitoring: Integration of Caterpillar\u2019s land-based telematics and asset management platforms.\n\n\u2022Cross-Sector R&D: Synergies with Caterpillar divisions developing hydrogen, electrification, and fuel flexibility.\n\nAs the maritime industry accelerates its transition toward low- and zero-emission propulsion, the big engine manufacturers \u2013 which have spent the last century evolving the efficiency and robustness of its engine line-ups \u2013 are today gearing up for a hybrid future, a future that for the next generation still includes traditional marine engines.\n\nBut that future engine room is already starting to morph to hybrid, with the inclusion of battery banks to help cut or eliminate emissions in particularly sensitive areas; with the preparation to burn now, or in the future, a long list of potential future fuels. While \u201cdecarbonization\u201d is more often than not the headline, trust that fuel efficiency is the payoff vessel owners seek.\n\nIt would stand to reason that the big OEMs \u2013 with the heft of scale across industries and R&D budgets that can help them look further ahead \u2013 are best positioned to benefit, and in the workboat sector there are few better positioned than Caterpillar.\n\nWith a global product portfolio spanning marine, land-based, and industrial markets, Caterpillar Marine is tapping into deep R&D investments across sectors to develop flexible propulsion solutions for tugboats, offshore vessels, and ferries. At the heart of this effort is Mass Maritime-graduate Will Watson, Marine Product Manager, Caterpillar, who is helping to steer the company\u2019s focus on hybrid systems, methanol-fueled engines and vessel design flexibility. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no time like it in the maritime industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a tremendous openness to exploring new technologies, balanced by uncertainty over which path will ultimately dominate. The one constant is that the conversation is happening across all corners of the industry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Systems\n\nCaterpillar is actively helping vessel owners evaluate hybrid propulsion systems as a means to reduce emissions and operating costs without abandoning the reliability of internal combustion. \u201cWhen owners come to us, the first question we ask is: \u2018What\u2019s your primary goal?\u2019\u201d Watson explained. \u201cWhether it\u2019s reducing operating costs, hitting emissions targets, or qualifying for a tender, that goal shapes the right solution.\u201d\n\nHybrid systems\u2014typically comprising traditional diesel engines supplemented with energy storage\u2014can offer measurable benefits in fuel savings and emissions reductions, particularly in workboat applications with variable load profiles. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily replacing all your engines with batteries,\u201d Watson said. \u201cInstead, you\u2019re sizing the battery system to optimize efficiency for your specific operating profile.\u201d\n\nHe added that the payback period often depends on fuel cost savings or regulatory compliance benefits. In emission-restricted zones, hybrid systems may be essential simply to operate. In other cases, operational savings alone justify the investment. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding that balance between upfront CapEx and long-term OpEx reduction.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen owners come to us, the first question we ask is: \u2018What\u2019s your primary goal?\u2019 Whether it\u2019s reducing operating costs, hitting emissions targets, or qualifying for a tender, that goal shapes the right solution.\u201d\n\n\uf06eWill Watson, Marine Product Manager, Caterpillar\n\nMethanol: A Viable Option for Workboats\n\nBeyond hybridization, Caterpillar is investing in combustion technologies that can accommodate alternative fuels\u2014particularly methanol. While land-based divisions of the company are exploring hydrogen, Caterpillar Marine sees alcohol-based fuels like methanol as a more practical near-term solution for maritime operators.\n\n\u201cFrom a handling and storage standpoint, methanol makes a lot of sense,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a liquid fuel, familiar to many ship operators, and it offers a clear emissions advantage.\u201d\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s dual-fuel engine development strategy centers on fuel flexibility. The goal is to allow a vessel operator to start with diesel or HVO, and later transition to methanol without replacing the engine. \u201cWe\u2019re designing engines to be agnostic, to evolve with whatever fuel becomes available or economically viable over the life of the vessel.\u201d\n\nWatson stressed the importance of designing vessels now with future fuel flexibility in mind. \u201cShipowners don\u2019t always know today what fuel will be available at their ports tomorrow. So we work closely with naval architects and owners to design vessels that can be retrofitted or adapted in five, 10 or even 20 years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Damen Tug Project\n\nA high-profile examples of Caterpillar\u2019s alternative fuel initiative is its collaboration with Damen Shipyards to deliver a methanol-powered tug using Caterpillar\u2019s 3500-series dual-fuel engine. \u201cThis project illustrates everything we\u2019ve talked about; collaboration, flexibility, and forward-looking design,\u201d Watson said.\n\nThe joint development involves shared learning across both companies: engine operation, vessel integration, fuel handling, and real-world performance expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s a living test case for how we bring methanol propulsion from the lab to the water,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building a one-off. We\u2019re creating a template for future vessels.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDigitalization, too\n\nAnother strategic advantage Caterpillar brings to the maritime sector is its access to a wider industrial ecosystem. Lessons learned from the company\u2019s work in construction, transportation, and energy are feeding directly into marine solutions. \u201cI talk regularly with product managers in other segments,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWhile we focus on methanol, others are advancing hydrogen or full electric solutions. Those insights help shape our development priorities.\u201d\n\nThat cross-sector experience is especially valuable in digitalization, where Caterpillar\u2019s expertise in connected assets and performance monitoring is being applied to maritime operations. \u201cWhether it\u2019s predictive maintenance or energy management, the digital tools we\u2019re developing elsewhere are directly transferrable to vessels,\u201d Watson said.\n\nLooking ahead, Watson urged shipowners and designers to build in flexibility from the outset. Whether planning for batteries, alternative fuels, or future regulations, early-stage decisions will determine whether a vessel can adapt over decades of service.\n\n\u201cThink about battery placement, deck space, tank configuration,\u201d he advised. \u201cIf you don\u2019t plan for change now, your vessel could become obsolete faster than you expect.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a seemingly dizzying array of choices to make, Watson emphasizes the basics: \u201cThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. But with the right tools, data, and design strategy, we can help owners navigate whatever comes next.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview with Will Watson on Maritime Reporter TV:\n\n\n\n",
