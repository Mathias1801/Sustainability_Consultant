Og de energi-intensive virksomheder er parat til at skifte til biogas og endda betale en betydelig ekstraomkostning for de certifikater, som garanterer gassens oprindelse.\n\nI EU-systemet og i lande som Sverige samt Tyskland har man for l\u00e6ngst anerkendt, at biogas ikke skal beskattes som sort energi. Men i Danmark beskatter vi biogas som naturgas, og det holder gr\u00f8nne investeringer tilbage.\n\nDet burde v\u00e6re \u00e5benlyst, at virksomheder, der investerer i at bruge gr\u00f8n energi i produktionen, ikke skal betale CO2-afgift. Men s\u00e5dan er verden desv\u00e6rre ikke skruet sammen \u2013 i hvert fald ikke i Danmark, n\u00e5r vi taler om biogas.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nFjern afgiften p\u00e5 biogas\n\nCirka ti procent af den dansk producerede biogas er st\u00f8ttefri, og denne biogas eksporteres typisk ud af landet til meget h\u00f8je priser.

Peter Trillingsgaard\n\nBranchedirekt\u00f8r, Dansk Industri\n\nFor nogle industrier er teknologien slet ikke til stede, og for andre virksomheder handler det om, at der er meget lange udsigter til, at vi i Danmark har en tilstr\u00e6kkelig el-infrastruktur p\u00e5 plads, s\u00e5 virksomheden f\u00e5r adgang til de n\u00f8dvendige m\u00e6ngder str\u00f8m.\n\nS\u00e5 skal vi lykkes med den gr\u00f8nne omstilling af den tunge industri, kr\u00e6ver det en fuld afgiftsfritagelse af biogassen, der kan bringe de resterende 90% i spil i industrien.\n\nSagen er i virkeligheden en pr\u00f8ve p\u00e5, om vi i Danmark form\u00e5r at samt\u00e6nke og forene vores gr\u00f8nne ambitioner og hensynet til industriens konkurrenceevne.\n\nDet er ikke rimeligt, at vi i Danmark lukker gr\u00f8nne d\u00f8re og ofrer industriens konkurrenceevne, fordi man administrativt vil g\u00e5 med b\u00e5de livrem og seler. Her er politikere og embedsm\u00e6nd n\u00f8dt til at udvise st\u00f8rre mod og fleksibilitet.\n\nDansk Industri opfordrer til, at regering og forligspartier overvejer situationen omkring biogas igen, s\u00e5 vi ikke ender i en situation, hvor danske skatteborgere betaler for produktion af biogas, som bruges i udlandet til at udkonkurrere vores virksomheder p\u00e5 den gr\u00f8nne dagsorden.",

      "text": "Rystad Energy has published groundbreaking research showing that liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as marine fuel produces significantly lower well-to-tank emissions than previously estimated by regulators.\n\nThe independent study, commissioned by SEA-LNG, found global well-to-tank emissions intensity for LNG bunkering fuel in 2024 is 13.9g CO2e/MJ (LHV), substantially below the EU\u2019s default value of 18.5g CO2e/MJ used in FuelEU Maritime regulations.\n\nThe research analyzed emissions from five key lifecycle stages: upstream production, transportation and processing, liquefaction, shipping, and distribution and bunkering operations. It was conducted following IMO well-to-tank lifecycle analysis guidelines and IPCC AR5 GHG definitions.\n\n\u201cOur analysis is based on asset-level data that ties specific gas fields to liquefaction facilities,\u201d explained Patrick King, Vice President Emissions Research at Rystad Energy. \u201cThis approach, supported by satellite-detected methane plume data and reported asset information, gives a more accurate picture of the LNG actually used for bunkering, rather than relying on outdated or overly broad averages.\u201d\n\nThe study determined that carbon dioxide dominates global WtT emissions at 84% of the total, with methane responsible for the remaining 16% (equivalent to 2.2 g CO2e/MJ). Notably, the liquefaction stage generated 43% of all emissions, while upstream gas production accounted for 30%.\n\nResults showed significant variation between regions and cargoes due to differences in gas sources, liquefaction technologies, and shipping distances. In some cases, emissions intensities varied by as much as 6.6 g CO2e/MJ.\n\nWith approximately 95% of vessels still using oil-based fuels, LNG has emerged as the leading alternative, now representing nearly 20% of the global vessel orderbook. As the shipping industry works toward decarbonization goals, understanding accurate lifecycle emissions data becomes increasingly critical for regulatory and investment decisions.\n\nPeter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG, called the report a landmark study that \u201csets the high standards the IMO should demand on such a key topic as alternative fuel emissions and performance within the Net-Zero Framework.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest that regulators, particularly those behind the EU\u2019s FuelEU Maritime initiative, should revise their emissions factors downward to reflect the latest research.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers must create regulations that reflect the true carbon intensity of marine fuels, rewarding reductions across the supply chain,\u201d said Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG. \u201cMarine regulators should incentivise participants in the LNG bunker supply chain to continue to reduce GHG emissions.\u201d",

      "text": "The United States is leaning hard on allies and rivals alike to reject a landmark United Nations agreement to slash emissions from marine fuels, Reuters reports. Washington has warned that nations pressing ahead with the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) proposed framework could face a battery of retaliatory measures \u2013 from tariffs and port levies to visa restrictions.\n\nThe extraordinary intervention follows months of wrangling at the IMO over its net-zero plan for shipping, due for a vote next month. \u201cWe are actively exploring and preparing to act on remedies including tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies should this effort succeed,\u201d a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters. \u201cWe will fight hard to protect the American people and their economic interests.\u201d Without clear, enforceable rules, shipowners can\u2019t responsibly future-proof their fleets\n\nThe stance has set the US on a collision course with the EU and a number of Pacific and Asian nations who back the deal.\n\nWashington\u2019s threat to weaponise tariffs and port access could torpedo years of delicate negotiations on shipping\u2019s climate pathway.\n\nIn a joint statement last month, US secretary of state Marco Rubio, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, energy secretary Chris Wright, and transportation secretary Sean Duffy said president Donald Trump would not accept \u201cany international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe proposed net-zero framework, agreed in principle by a majority of IMO member states in April, seeks to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector by introducing fuel standards and levies on ships that fail to meet strict targets. Proponents say the measures are critical to meeting the IMO\u2019s 2050 climate goals, but the US delegation has argued the rules would disproportionately benefit China and penalise fuels where US industry leads such as LNG and biofuels.\n\nThe stance is consistent with April\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session, where US negotiators walked out of talks. In April\u2019s vote, 63 member states \u2014 including China, Brazil and EU nations \u2014 backed the framework, while 16 opposed.\n\nThe agreement constitutes a fuel standard, as such a mandate on the GHG intensity of energy used, coupled with a pricing and trading mechanism.\n\nShips that do not reduce their intensity of GHG emissions \u2013 including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \u2014 in line with two reduction trajectories outlined in the new regulations, which still need to be promulgated at the next MEPC in October, are deemed to have an emissions deficit. This must then be addressed by buying so-called remedial units.\n\nThe October decision will require a two-thirds majority \u2013 108 of the 176 IMO members that have ratified the relevant convention \u2013 if consensus cannot be reached.\n\nThe IMO rarely resorts to voting, but with positions hardening, a formal ballot looks increasingly likely.\n\nEnvironmental NGOs have condemned the US position, warning that further delay in regulating marine fuel emissions risks undermining the sector\u2019s ability to meet climate targets.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming MEPC session in October provides the appropriate platform to address any concerns from member states ahead of the adoption process,\u201d a spokesperson for the IMO told Splash last month.\n\nA spokesperson from BIMCO, shipping\u2019s largest lobby group, told Splash the US stance is unlikely to derail implementation if the framework passes, but warned that Washington\u2019s non-participation would complicate enforcement.\n\n\u201cEven when, or if, the US places reservations that the rules will not apply to them, it will, because all ships of non-US flag trading internationally are bound by their flag.US ships will also be required to comply if they trade internationally. There is only the option of non-party bilateral trade outside the rules,\u201d the BIMCO spokesperson explained last month.\n\nFor shipowners, the bigger headache may be the uncertainty the US move injects into fuel investment decisions. Broker SSY said dry bulk ordering remains paralysed by the absence of clear, stable rules, with owners hedging between LNG, ammonia, and methanol in the hope of future-proofing fleets.\n\n\u201cConfidence matters more than rhetoric in shipping as without clear, enforceable rules, shipowners can\u2019t responsibly future-proof their fleets, and decarbonisation will remain as just a costly exercise in risk management,\u201d SSY noted in a recent markets update.",

      "text": "Danish company \u00d8rsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables have filed a lawsuit in the DC District Court to reverse a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project.\n\nThe project was 80% complete when the stop-work order was issued. Rhode Island and Connecticut, the two states that were supposed to benefit from the project, are also suing the federal government.\n\nThe order suspended the project after all offshore foundations were in place and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. Export cable installation is nearly complete, as is 90% of the onshore substation. The project was scheduled to be finished next year.\n\nRevolution Wind, a joint venture between wind developer \u00d8rsted and Skyborn Renewables, said it had already spent about $5bn on the project, and that it will incur costs of another $1bn if the order remains in place.\n\nThe project, which is supposed to provide enough energy to power upwards of 350,000 homes, supports over 2,000 jobs in the US.\n\nA joint news release from the attorneys general of the two states claimed that Revolution Wind was projected to \u201csave Connecticut and Rhode Island ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years\u201d.\n\nThey said that they set out to \u201crestore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the federal government honours its commitments\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution, it believes that BOEM lacked legal authority for the stop-work order and that the stop-work order\u2019s stated basis violated applicable law. The project is facing substantial harm from the continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step,\u201d Revolution Wind said in a statement.",

      "text": "Depending on the ship type, the dry bulk shipping market tells a very different story so far this year. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Xclusiv said that \u201cnow that summer has come to an end, it is a good moment to look back and assess how the dry bulk market evolved through the season, comparing the performance of summer 2025 with the previous two summers. Seasonal patterns are often a reliable barometer of underlying demand, with June to August setting the tone for the final quarter of the year. From 2023 onwards, the market has told three very different stories, with Capesizes showing volatility, Panamaxes too, while geared segments displayed resilience & stability\u201d.\n\nAccording to Xclusiv, \u201cin the Capesize market, the summer of 2023 stood out for its strength. The season began with C5TC near USD 9,700/day in early June, reflecting weak iron ore flows. Yet as the summer advanced, Chinese restocking and firmer Atlantic activity triggered a sharp recovery. By late August, Capesizes were earning around USD 21,300/day, more than double the opening level and right at the seasonal high. The following year, 2024, painted a different picture. C5TC opened June at USD 23,300/day and climbed into the low USD 32,000s by July, giving the impression of another robust season. However, momentum quickly faded, and by the end of August rates had slipped back to USD 23,900/day, almost identical to the opening level. This year, 2025, the pattern has been similar. Starting June at USD 19,000/day, Capes peaked near USD 31,700/day in late July, only to retreat below USD 24,000/day at the end of August. For a third consecutive summer, the largest vessels failed to consolidate gains, leaving the season defined by volatility\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cPanamaxes, by contrast, have been steadier. In 2023, the P5TC began June just above USD 9,200/day and closed August at USD 13,500/day, close to its high. In 2024, P5TC opened at USD 15,100/day, briefly touched USD 17,600/day in mid-June, but ended the summer almost flat at USD 15,600/day. This year, however, the picture has been more positive. Panamaxes started June 2025 at USD 10,000/day and climbed throughout the season to finish August at nearly USD 16,800/day, closing on their highs and offering owners a constructive run. Supramaxes and Handysizes have shown even greater resilience. In 2023 S11TC moved from USD 11,100/day in June to USD 13,600/day in August, while in 2024 they strengthened from USD 12,000/day to USD 16,600/day, closing at the top. The summer of 2025 extended this trend: from USD 12,000/day in early June, Supras rose steadily to USD 18,400/day at the end of August, the strongest close of the summer period. Handys followed the same path. From USD 10,800/day in June 2023 they ended that summer at USD 12,800/day, while in 2024 they climbed from USD 12,000/day to USD 13,500/day. This year, HS7TC from USD 10,779/day on early June, advanced to USD 13,600/day by late August, again finishing on the seasonal peak\u201d, Xclusiv noted.\n\nThe shipbroker added that \u201cthe conclusion of this year\u2019s summer cannot be separated from developments in China\u2019s coal market. Domestic output surged 5.4% year on year in the first half of 2025, curbing demand for imports. But when heavy rains and a government crackdown hit mining in July, production fell 3.8% year on year to its lowest since April 2024. This disruption reopened the arbitrage for seaborne cargoes, reviving Chinese demand just as geared vessel earnings were firming. Imports totalled 139.7m tons in H1 2025, down from 174.6m tons a year earlier, but enquiries rose in late summer as domestic supply faltered. The impact was clear: while Capes struggled to hold their gains, Panamaxes, Supramaxes and Handys ended August on their highs. Summer 2025 confirmed once again that in an uncertain Capesize environment, shifting Chinese coal fundamentals can still underpin strength for the geared fleet, cementing their role as the backbone of stability in the dry bulk market\u201d, Xclusiv concluded.\n\nNikos Roussanoglou, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",

According to reports, that number stands at around 13,000. This means that the cuts would impact between 2,600 and 3,250 workers.

      "text": "LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) \u2013 The United States has told countries to reject a United Nations\u2019 marine fuel emissions-cutting deal or face tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies, U.S. and European officials and sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Trump administration is looking to boost U.S. economic might, including by taking a bigger role in global shipping, and has used tariffs as a weapon to extract better terms from Washington\u2019s trade partners.\n\nIn April, countries struck a draft agreement through the U.N.\u2019s International Maritime Organization (IMO) that would impose a fee on ships that breach global carbon emissions standards.\n\nWashington pulled out of the talks in April leading up to the draft deal, and said in August it would retaliate against countries that supported the accord. It has argued the measures would place unnecessary burdens on the shipping industry, and would be of little help to reduce emissions.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has reached out to other IMO member countries in recent days warning them not to adopt the so-called \u201cNet-Zero Framework\u201d, according to four sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the U.S. was \u201cactively exploring and preparing to act on remedies including tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies should this effort succeed in the October IMO extraordinary session vote.\u201d\n\nThe department will be engaging \u201cour partners and allies\u201d to propose they take similar measures, the spokesperson said, but would not comment on \u201cprivate diplomatic discussions with other countries.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch government received a verbal warning from representatives of the U.S. government, who said the Netherlands could face tariffs or other retaliatory measures if it supported the adoption of the framework, a spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management said.\n\nIt was unclear which other IMO countries had been approached by Washington.\n\nThe London-based IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution.\n\nGlobal shipping accounts for nearly 3% of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, and the IMO deal was designed to speed up decarbonisation. About 90% of the world\u2019s trade is conducted by sea, and emissions are set to soar without an agreed mechanism.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming (IMO) session in October provides the appropriate platform to address any concerns from member states ahead of the adoption process,\u201d an IMO spokesperson said.\n\nThe initial deal was passed by 63 states, with 16 voting no and 24 abstentions. A majority will be required for adoption if it goes to a vote, and sources said it was unclear if it could pass if more countries abstained.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Saul, Kate Abnett, Nerijus Adomaitis, Valerie Volcovici, Enes Tunagur and Bart Meijer; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nSubscribe for Daily Maritime Insights Sign up for gCaptain\u2019s newsletter and never miss an update \u2014 trusted by our 108,169 members\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.",
