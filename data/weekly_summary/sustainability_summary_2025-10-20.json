Geopolitical factors heavily influenced the trajectory of international climate policy, while industry players continued to explore innovative solutions.\n\n### Legislative insight\n\nThe most prominent development is the **postponement of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Net-Zero Framework and its proposed global carbon pricing system for shipping**. After extensive negotiations, member states voted to delay the adoption of this landmark agreement by one year, pushing the decision to October 2026. This framework, initially agreed in principle in April, aimed to introduce a global carbon tax (e.g., $100 per ton of CO2 for emissions exceeding a cap) and a global fuel standard to align shipping with net-zero targets by 2050.\n\nThe delay was largely attributed to an intense pressure campaign led by the United States, supported by Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other oil-producing nations. The US administration reportedly employed diplomatic threats, including potential tariffs, sanctions, and visa restrictions against countries that supported the tax. Procedural tactics, such as proposing a shift from \"tacit acceptance\" to \"explicit acceptance\" for new regulations, were also used to complicate the adoption process. The US framed the tax as a burden on consumers and a potential \"environmental slush fund.\"\n\nDespite strong initial support for the framework and the European Union's push for its adoption, divisions emerged. Greece, a major shipping nation and EU member, reportedly shifted from supporting the initial draft to planning an abstention, citing concerns about industry impact and cost inflation. The postponement has cast uncertainty over the IMO's ability to meet its 2030 reduction targets for shipping. While the main adoption vote is delayed, technical discussions on the framework's details are expected to continue.\n\nSeparately, the **EU Commission is reportedly pursuing a strategy to bypass the US federal administration by directly engaging with individual American states** to promote green exports and foster green trade and investment. This approach indicates an effort to advance sustainability initiatives on a sub-national level in the face of federal opposition.\n\n### Industry insight\n\nAmidst the legislative uncertainty, the industry is also pushing forward with new solutions. **Lloyd's Register has unveiled the first comprehensive roadmap for integrating nuclear technology into commercial shipping**. Developed in partnership with Global Nuclear Security Partners and marine insurer NorthStandard, this guidance addresses regulatory, technical, operational, and financial requirements for deploying solutions like small modular reactors (SMRs). This initiative signals a growing interest in nuclear power as a scalable, zero-carbon propulsion option for the maritime sector, aiming to fill a critical knowledge gap despite the current lack of a unified international regulatory framework.\n\nIn Europe, efforts continue to enhance sustainable logistics infrastructure. An upcoming **European conference in November 2025 will focus on \"green inland ports,\"** presenting findings from a study and gathering stakeholder input for policy recommendations on sustainable port governance. This highlights ongoing regional initiatives to decarbonize port operations and integrate them into broader green supply chains.\n\nThe shipping industry, including major players like Danish shipping companies, expressed significant disappointment over the IMO's carbon tax postponement. They emphasized the critical need for global regulatory clarity to enable essential investments in decarbonization technologies and green fuels. Concerns were raised that the delay could lead to a fragmented \"patchwork\" of national and regional regulations, hindering the industry's green transition.\n\n### General awareness\n\nThe geopolitical tensions surrounding the IMO climate tax negotiations brought global climate action into sharp focus. The strong-arm tactics employed by the US administration and the resulting delay drew **condemnation from environmental groups and climate-vulnerable Pacific Island states**, who labeled it a \"betrayal.\" The debate highlighted the intensity of political opposition to binding international climate regulations and the use of economic leverage in such negotiations. The US administration, conversely, publicly declared the postponement a \"huge win\" for American consumers, framing the proposed tax as a \"climate scam.\""
