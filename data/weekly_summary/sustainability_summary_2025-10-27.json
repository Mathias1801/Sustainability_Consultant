For a corporate strategist at Maersk, the focus remains sharply on the evolving regulatory landscape for shipping, advancements in green technologies, and broader sustainable transport initiatives.\n\n### Legislative insight\n\nDiscussions within the **International Maritime Organization (IMO)** continue on its Net-Zero Framework, which includes a global greenhouse gas pricing system for shipping \u2013 effectively a carbon tax. Despite a one-year postponement on the framework's adoption, working groups are actively refining guidelines. Key debates revolve around the role of biofuels, with some nations advocating for a \"technology neutral\" approach that includes existing crop-based biofuels, while others, including the EU and Pacific Island states, express sustainability and scalability concerns, favoring renewable e-fuels. Efforts are also underway to finalize Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines for marine fuels by April 2026.\n\nIn the aviation sector, the **European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)** released its first annual report on the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. The report indicates positive progress in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) uptake, primarily from used cooking oil and waste animal fats, confirming the EU is on track for its 2030 mandatory blending target. The European Commission is also preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan to boost investments in renewable and low-carbon transport fuels, including SAF.\n\nLooking at inland logistics, a forthcoming **Green Inland Ports final conference** will present key findings from a study on port decarbonization and gather stakeholder input for policy recommendations on sustainable port governance, signaling potential future regulatory directions for port operations across Europe.\n\n### Industry insight\n\nThe shipping industry is actively exploring advanced decarbonization solutions. **HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering** received an Approval in Principle from DNV for a 15,000 TEU container vessel design powered by nuclear-powered Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. This marks a significant step in assessing the feasibility and safety of nuclear propulsion for commercial shipping, highlighting a potential long-term, zero-emission pathway.\n\n**Maersk Offshore Wind**, a part of Maersk, is currently involved in an arbitration dispute over a nearly completed wind turbine installation vessel. This vessel was intended for the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project off New York, designed to power 500,000 homes. While the news is about a contractual dispute, it underscores Maersk's strategic involvement and investment in large-scale renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nIn Brazil, **Transpetro**, a Petrobras subsidiary, launched a public tender for 36 new inland vessels (18 barges and 18 pusher tugs). These vessels are intended to expand fuel logistics, including petroleum products and biofuels, signaling an expansion of the country's inland waterway transport capacity with an emphasis on diversified and potentially greener fuel options.\n\nThe **Danish shipping industry** is advocating strongly for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a crucial pathway to meet EU climate goals. Danish Shipping emphasizes the need for clear targets, reduced barriers, and investments in infrastructure to establish an internal CO2 market in Europe that can be serviced by maritime transport. This highlights a sector-wide push for broader decarbonization solutions beyond immediate fuel switching.\n\n### General awareness\n\nDespite the delay in the IMO Net-Zero Framework's adoption, industry leaders at the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit expressed continued hope and energy for decarbonization, viewing the delay as a pause rather than a halt. However, concerns persist among researchers and civil society groups regarding the sustainability of crop-based biofuels, advocating for robust Life Cycle Assessment guidelines to prevent indirect land-use change emissions.\n\nIn aviation, while the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is growing, the EASA report noted that the market remains highly concentrated, with the vast majority of supply originating from only five EU Member States and synthetic fuels still in early developmental stages. This points to ongoing challenges in scaling broad and diversified sustainable fuel production.\n\n### Relevant Articles and Content:\n\n*   **IMO Net-Zero Framework Negotiations Continue Despite Adoption Vote Delay**\n    *   **Content:** The International Maritime Organization is continuing discussions on a global carbon pricing system for shipping, despite a one-year delay in its formal adoption. Key disagreements persist regarding the role of biofuels (crop-based vs. e-fuels), with sustainability and scalability concerns raised by various nations and civil society groups. Support for wind propulsion as a zero- or near-zero energy source was broadly expressed. The IMO Net-Zero Fund, intended to ensure an equitable transition, was also discussed.\n\n*   **DNV Awards HD KSOE Approval in Principle for Nuclear-Powered Containership Design**\n    *   **Content:** Classification society DNV has granted Approval in Principle to HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering for a 15,000 TEU container vessel design utilizing nuclear-powered Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. This development signifies a major step in exploring nuclear propulsion as a potential solution for maritime decarbonization, with a focus on safety and advanced power generation systems.\n\n*   **Maersk Offshore Wind Takes Seatrium to Arbitration Over Nearly Completed Wind Installation Vessel**\n    *   **Content:** Maersk Offshore Wind has initiated arbitration proceedings against Seatrium Limited concerning the termination of a contract for a wind turbine installation vessel. This vessel was intended for deployment at the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project off New York. The dispute highlights Maersk's involvement in renewable energy infrastructure projects as part of its broader sustainability and decarbonization strategy.\n\n*   **Transpetro launches tender for 36 inland vessels to expand fuel logistics**\n    *   **Content:** Brazil's Transpetro has opened a tender for the construction of 18 barges and 18 pusher tugs. These vessels are designed to expand the company's inland fuel transport capabilities, including both petroleum products and biofuels, aiming to enhance its operational capacity and diversify logistics solutions.\n\n*   **New report shows progress in sustainable aviation fuel uptake across the EU**\n    *   **Content:** The first annual report on the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation shows increased Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production capacity in the EU, mostly from used cooking oil and waste animal fats, putting the region on track for its 2030 blending target. The report also notes the early stage of synthetic fuel development and the concentration of SAF supply in a few Member States. The EU is preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan to boost investments in clean transport fuels.\n\n*   **Velkommen til Danske Rederier**\n    *   **Content:** Danish Shipping advocates for the necessity of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to achieve EU climate goals. They call for clear objectives, reduced barriers, and investment in infrastructure to establish an internal CO2 market in Europe, emphasizing the role of maritime transport in this system.\n\n*   **Green inland ports final conference**\n    *   **Content:** An upcoming conference will bring together European port and waterway authorities, policymakers, and other stakeholders to present findings from a green inland ports study. The event will showcase tools for port decarbonization and gather input for policy recommendations on sustainable port governance."
